1. Fix missing type definitions (e.g., creating/importing types)
2. Fix incorrect imports (e.g., ElementalProperties, LunarPhase)
3. Update string indexing issues (e.g., in elementalUtils)
4. Fix fetch API timeout issues
5. Fix interface conformity with Korean cuisine

## Most Common Errors

- Missing types or incorrect imports
- String indexing without proper typings
- Interface mismatches
- Fetch API timeout property issues

## Summary

There are over 800 errors across 145 files, suggesting that a systematic
approach is needed. After fixing the core type definitions and imports, we
should focus on the most frequently occurring errors.
