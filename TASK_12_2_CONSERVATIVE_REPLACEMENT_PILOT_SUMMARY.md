  minFilesPerBatch: 10,        // Minimum 10 files per batch
  targetSuccessRate: 0.8,      // Target >80% successful replacements
  maxBatches: 10,              // Maximum 10 batches for pilot
  realTimeValidation: true,    // Enable real-time validation
  rollbackOnFailure: true,     // Rollback on build failures
  safetyThreshold: 0.7,        // Safety threshold for replacements
  focusCategories: [           // Focus on high-confidence categories
    AnyTypeCategory.ARRAY_TYPE,
    AnyTypeCategory.RECORD_TYPE
  ],
  buildValidationFrequency: 1  // Validate after every batch
}
```
