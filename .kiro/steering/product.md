## Core Workflows

### 1. Astrological Meal Planning Workflow

**Primary Flow:**
1. **Cosmic Context Assessment**
   - Calculate current planetary positions using astronomy-engine
   - Determine lunar phase and seasonal astronomical state
   - Assess elemental influences based on celestial conditions

2. **Personal Profile Integration**
   - Analyze user's astrological chart and elemental constitution
   - Consider personal dietary preferences and restrictions
   - Factor in cultural background and culinary traditions

3. **Recommendation Generation**
   - Match ingredients with current elemental influences
   - Suggest cooking methods aligned with planetary energies
   - Provide timing recommendations for optimal cosmic alignment

4. **Adaptive Refinement**
   - Learn from user feedback and preferences
   - Adjust recommendations based on seasonal changes
   - Evolve suggestions as planetary positions shift

### 2. Elemental Harmony Matching Workflow

**Core Principles:**
- **Fire Element**: Energizing foods, spicy ingredients, quick cooking methods
- **Water Element**: Cooling foods, fluid-rich ingredients, steaming and boiling
- **Earth Element**: Grounding foods, root vegetables, slow cooking methods
- **Air Element**: Light foods, leafy greens, raw preparations

**Harmony Calculation:**
- All elements are individually valuable and beneficial
- No opposing elements - all combinations have good compatibility (0.7+ score)
- Same-element combinations have highest affinity (0.9+ score)
- Self-reinforcement principle: elements work best with themselves

### 3. Seasonal Adaptation Workflow

**Astronomical Seasons:**
- **Spring Equinox**: Fresh, cleansing foods with Air and Water elements
- **Summer Solstice**: Cooling, hydrating foods with Water and Earth elements
- **Autumn Equinox**: Grounding, harvesting foods with Earth and Fire elements
- **Winter Solstice**: Warming, nourishing foods with Fire and Air elements

**Lunar Phase Integration:**
- **New Moon**: Detoxifying and cleansing foods
- **Waxing Moon**: Building and nourishing foods
- **Full Moon**: Balancing and harmonizing foods
- **Waning Moon**: Releasing and purifying foods

### 4. Cultural Integration Workflow

**Cuisine Compatibility Assessment:**
- Match cultural cooking traditions with astrological principles
- Respect authentic preparation methods while adding cosmic timing
- Integrate traditional ingredient combinations with elemental harmony
- Honor cultural dietary customs within astrological framework

## Core Philosophy Integration

### The 14 Alchemical Pillars
Our system is built upon the 14 Alchemical Pillars that govern the transformation of ingredients into nourishing meals:

1. **Elemental Harmony**: Balance of Fire, Water, Earth, and Air in every meal
2. **Planetary Correspondence**: Alignment with current celestial influences
3. **Seasonal Attunement**: Harmony with astronomical cycles and natural rhythms
4. **Cultural Resonance**: Respect for traditional culinary wisdom
5. **Nutritional Alchemy**: Transformation of ingredients into optimal nutrition
6. **Temporal Alignment**: Consideration of optimal timing for preparation and consumption
7. **Personal Constitution**: Adaptation to individual astrological and physical needs
8. **Ingredient Synergy**: Understanding of how ingredients enhance each other
9. **Preparation Intention**: Mindful cooking as a form of culinary meditation
10. **Flavor Harmony**: Balance of tastes that reflect elemental principles
11. **Color Spectrum**: Visual appeal that honors the full spectrum of natural colors
12. **Texture Integration**: Variety of textures that engage all senses
13. **Aromatic Alchemy**: Use of scents and aromatics to enhance the dining experience
14. **Gratitude Practice**: Recognition of the cosmic forces that bring food to our table

### Elemental Self-Reinforcement Principle
A fundamental principle of our system is that elements work best with themselves:
- Fire + Fire = Maximum energy and vitality
- Water + Water = Deep nourishment and flow
- Earth + Earth = Grounding and stability
- Air + Air = Lightness and mental clarity

This principle guides our recommendation algorithms to suggest ingredient combinations that amplify elemental qualities rather than seeking to balance opposing forces.

## Integration with Development Workflows

### Astrological Calculation Reliability
- All planetary position calculations must be validated against transit dates
- Fallback mechanisms must be in place for API failures or calculation errors
- Local data stores must maintain the most recent reliable astronomical data
- Error handling must gracefully degrade to cached positions when needed

### Campaign System Integration
- Quality metrics must include astrological calculation accuracy
- Automated testing must validate astronomical edge cases
- Performance monitoring must track calculation speed and reliability
- Error reduction campaigns must preserve astrological logic integrity

### Cultural Sensitivity in Development
- Code comments and documentation must respect diverse astrological traditions
- Testing scenarios must include various cultural contexts and dietary restrictions
- User interface elements must be culturally neutral while honoring astrological principles
- Data structures must accommodate diverse ingredient names and preparation methods
