# Test System Stabilization Requirements

## Introduction

The WhatToEatNext application is experiencing critical test failures, memory issues, and build problems that are preventing proper validation and deployment. This spec addresses the systematic resolution of these issues to restore system stability and ensure reliable testing infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Critical Test Infrastructure Repair

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a stable test environment so that I can validate code changes and ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN all test infrastructure components SHALL function without memory errors
2. WHEN tests execute THEN memory usage SHALL remain below 4GB heap limit
3. WHEN test workers spawn THEN they SHALL complete without SIGABRT termination
4. IF memory pressure occurs THEN tests SHALL gracefully handle resource constraints
5. WHEN test setup runs THEN all required dependencies SHALL be properly initialized

### Requirement 2: Missing Module Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all module imports to resolve correctly so that tests can execute without import errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests import `elementalCalculations` THEN the module SHALL be properly exported and available
2. WHEN tests import `createLogger` THEN the logger utility SHALL be properly accessible
3. WHEN components import dependencies THEN all paths SHALL resolve correctly
4. IF modules are missing THEN clear error messages SHALL indicate the resolution path
5. WHEN build processes run THEN all required files SHALL be generated correctly

### Requirement 3: Build System Stabilization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system to complete successfully so that the application can be deployed and tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `yarn build` THEN the build SHALL complete without fatal errors
2. WHEN Next.js processes routes THEN all API routes SHALL be properly generated
3. WHEN static generation occurs THEN all pages SHALL be pre-rendered successfully
4. IF build errors occur THEN they SHALL be clearly identified and actionable
5. WHEN build artifacts are created THEN all manifest files SHALL be properly generated
6. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN all type errors SHALL be resolved systematically
7. WHEN type safety is validated THEN unsafe type conversions SHALL be eliminated
8. WHEN property access occurs THEN proper type guards SHALL prevent runtime errors
9. WHEN function calls are made THEN argument types SHALL match parameter signatures
10. WHEN imports are resolved THEN all type definitions SHALL be properly available
11. WHEN CI/CD quality gates run THEN TypeScript error count SHALL be below threshold

### Requirement 4: Memory Management Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to run efficiently within memory constraints so that the CI/CD pipeline remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests execute THEN memory usage SHALL not exceed 2GB per worker process
2. WHEN long-running tests run THEN memory SHALL be properly garbage collected
3. WHEN test suites complete THEN memory SHALL be released appropriately
4. IF memory leaks occur THEN they SHALL be detected and resolved
5. WHEN concurrent tests run THEN memory allocation SHALL be managed efficiently

### Requirement 5: Test Suite Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to pass consistently so that I can trust the validation results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN safety protocol tests run THEN they SHALL complete within timeout limits
2. WHEN integration tests execute THEN they SHALL properly mock external dependencies
3. WHEN validation tests run THEN they SHALL accurately reflect system state
4. IF test failures occur THEN they SHALL be reproducible and debuggable
5. WHEN test assertions execute THEN they SHALL validate the correct system behavior

### Requirement 6: Campaign System Test Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want campaign system tests to validate functionality without causing system instability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN campaign tests run THEN they SHALL not trigger actual build processes during testing
2. WHEN safety protocols are tested THEN they SHALL use mocked file system operations
3. WHEN progress tracking is tested THEN it SHALL not consume excessive memory
4. IF campaign triggers activate THEN they SHALL be properly isolated in test environment
5. WHEN campaign metrics are collected THEN they SHALL use test-appropriate data sources

### Requirement 7: Logger System Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent logging system so that all components can properly log information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components create loggers THEN the `createLogger` function SHALL be available
2. WHEN logging occurs THEN it SHALL not interfere with test execution
3. WHEN log levels are set THEN they SHALL be appropriate for the environment
4. IF logging errors occur THEN they SHALL not crash the application
5. WHEN tests run THEN logging SHALL be properly mocked or suppressed

### Requirement 8: Dependency Resolution Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all project dependencies to be properly resolved so that imports work consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compiles THEN all import paths SHALL resolve correctly
2. WHEN modules are imported THEN circular dependencies SHALL be avoided
3. WHEN barrel exports are used THEN they SHALL not create undefined exports
4. IF dependency issues occur THEN they SHALL be clearly identified in error messages
5. WHEN the module graph is analyzed THEN it SHALL be free of broken references
