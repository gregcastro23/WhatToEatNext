# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification focuses on optimizing Kiro's settings and workspace configuration to maximize productivity and leverage all available features for the "WhatToEatNext" project. The goal is to create a comprehensive Kiro setup that aligns with the project's astrology-driven food recommendation architecture, supports efficient development workflows, and provides intelligent automation for the complex TypeScript/React/Next.js codebase with astrological calculations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project-Specific Steering Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive steering files that understand the project's unique architecture, so that Kiro can provide contextually relevant assistance for astrology-driven food recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro analyzes code THEN it SHALL understand the elemental harmony approach and alchemical principles
2. WHEN providing recommendations THEN Kiro SHALL respect the four-element system (Fire, Water, Earth, Air) philosophy
3. WHEN working with astrological calculations THEN Kiro SHALL understand the planetary position system and transit validation
4. WHEN suggesting code changes THEN Kiro SHALL maintain consistency with the 14 Alchemical Pillars system
5. IF working with ingredient data THEN Kiro SHALL understand the elemental properties and culinary correspondences

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Kiro Settings Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized Kiro settings for TypeScript/React development with astrological libraries, so that I can work efficiently with the complex codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing TypeScript files THEN Kiro SHALL provide enhanced IntelliSense and error detection
2. WHEN working with React components THEN Kiro SHALL understand the component architecture and patterns
3. WHEN editing astrological calculations THEN Kiro SHALL provide appropriate syntax highlighting and validation
4. WHEN working with CSS modules THEN Kiro SHALL provide proper styling support
5. IF using astronomical libraries THEN Kiro SHALL understand the specialized type definitions

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Agent Hooks for Automation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated agent hooks that handle routine tasks, so that I can focus on core development while maintaining code quality and data accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planetary data files are modified THEN hooks SHALL validate transit dates and positions
2. WHEN ingredient files are updated THEN hooks SHALL verify elemental properties consistency
3. WHEN core calculation files change THEN hooks SHALL run relevant tests automatically
4. WHEN TypeScript errors exceed threshold THEN hooks SHALL trigger cleanup campaigns
5. IF linting issues are detected THEN hooks SHALL offer automated fixes

### Requirement 4: MCP Integration for External APIs

**User Story:** As a developer, I want MCP servers configured for astrological and nutritional APIs, so that I can access real-time data with proper fallback mechanisms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to astrological APIs THEN MCP SHALL provide reliable data access
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN MCP SHALL implement proper fallback to local data
3. WHEN nutritional data is needed THEN MCP SHALL connect to appropriate food databases
4. WHEN credentials are required THEN MCP SHALL manage them securely
5. IF API rate limits are hit THEN MCP SHALL implement appropriate throttling

### Requirement 5: Spec-Driven Development Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized spec templates and workflows, so that I can efficiently plan and implement complex features like astrological meal planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new specs THEN templates SHALL include EARS-format acceptance criteria
2. WHEN defining requirements THEN specs SHALL consider astrological timing and elemental factors
3. WHEN designing features THEN specs SHALL integrate with existing alchemical systems
4. WHEN planning tasks THEN specs SHALL break down complex astrological calculations appropriately
5. IF specs reference external systems THEN they SHALL include proper integration documentation

### Requirement 6: Optimized Interface and Workspace Layout

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an optimized Kiro interface layout, so that I can efficiently navigate the complex project structure and access frequently used components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening the workspace THEN key directories SHALL be easily accessible in the sidebar
2. WHEN using the command palette THEN frequently used commands SHALL be prioritized
3. WHEN working with multiple files THEN the layout SHALL support efficient switching
4. WHEN debugging THEN relevant tools and panels SHALL be readily available
5. IF working with astrological data THEN specialized views SHALL be accessible

### Requirement 7: Documentation and Onboarding System

**User Story:** As a team member, I want comprehensive documentation and onboarding materials, so that new contributors can quickly understand both Kiro and the project architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new contributors join THEN onboarding guides SHALL explain both Kiro features and project concepts
2. WHEN working with astrological concepts THEN documentation SHALL provide clear explanations
3. WHEN using specialized tools THEN guides SHALL explain their purpose and usage
4. WHEN following workflows THEN step-by-step instructions SHALL be available
5. IF questions arise THEN comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting guides SHALL be accessible

### Requirement 8: Performance and Error Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance monitoring and error tracking integrated into Kiro, so that I can maintain code quality and identify issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code performance degrades THEN monitoring SHALL alert developers
2. WHEN TypeScript errors accumulate THEN tracking SHALL provide actionable insights
3. WHEN build times increase THEN analysis SHALL identify bottlenecks
4. WHEN memory usage spikes THEN monitoring SHALL provide detailed reports
5. IF critical errors occur THEN alerts SHALL trigger appropriate responses

### Requirement 9: Code Quality and Maintenance Automation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated code quality maintenance, so that the codebase remains clean and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unused imports accumulate THEN automation SHALL clean them up
2. WHEN linting violations occur THEN fixes SHALL be applied automatically where safe
3. WHEN code patterns drift THEN enforcement SHALL maintain consistency
4. WHEN dependencies update THEN compatibility SHALL be verified
5. IF security vulnerabilities are detected THEN appropriate actions SHALL be taken

### Requirement 10: Integration with Existing Campaign Systems

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Kiro to integrate with the existing campaign systems, so that code improvement campaigns can be managed efficiently through Kiro's interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN campaign systems are active THEN Kiro SHALL provide monitoring and control interfaces
2. WHEN campaigns complete THEN results SHALL be integrated into Kiro's reporting
3. WHEN new campaigns are needed THEN Kiro SHALL facilitate their creation and execution
4. WHEN campaign conflicts arise THEN Kiro SHALL provide resolution mechanisms
5. IF campaigns fail THEN Kiro SHALL provide debugging and recovery options
