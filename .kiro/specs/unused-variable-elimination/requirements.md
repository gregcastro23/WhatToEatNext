# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the systematic elimination of the remaining 624 unused variables in the WhatToEatNext project, building upon the successful 3-wave unused variable transformation campaign that has already eliminated 452 variables (42.0% reduction) while maintaining perfect domain preservation. The system must continue to preserve domain-specific patterns for astrological calculations, campaign systems, service layer business logic, and culinary domain variables while achieving a target of sub-550 total warnings (approaching 50% total reduction milestone) through intelligent batch processing and advanced safety protocols.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Systematic Variable Analysis and Categorization

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining code quality, I want comprehensive analysis of all remaining unused variables, so that I can apply targeted elimination strategies based on variable types and contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes unused variables THEN it SHALL categorize them by file type (components, services, utilities, data, tests)
2. WHEN the system encounters astrological domain variables THEN it SHALL preserve variables named planet, degree, sign, longitude, position, coordinates
3. WHEN the system encounters campaign system variables THEN it SHALL preserve variables named metrics, progress, safety, campaign, validation, intelligence
4. WHEN the system processes test files THEN it SHALL preserve variables named mock, stub, test, expect, describe, it
5. WHEN the system identifies truly unused variables THEN it SHALL mark them for elimination with confidence scoring

### Requirement 2: Domain-Aware Preservation Patterns

**User Story:** As a developer working with astrological calculations, I want unused variable elimination to preserve domain-specific patterns, so that astronomical calculations and campaign systems remain functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing astrological calculation files THEN the system SHALL preserve planetary position variables even if temporarily unused
2. WHEN processing campaign system files THEN the system SHALL preserve metrics and monitoring variables for future intelligence features
3. WHEN encountering complex astronomical libraries THEN the system SHALL apply conservative elimination patterns
4. WHEN processing elemental calculation files THEN the system SHALL preserve Fire, Water, Earth, Air related variables
5. WHEN handling recipe and ingredient files THEN the system SHALL preserve culinary domain variables

### Requirement 3: Batch Processing with Safety Protocols

**User Story:** As a developer ensuring code stability, I want unused variable elimination to process files in safe batches with validation, so that build stability is maintained throughout the cleanup process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing unused variables THEN the system SHALL process files in batches of maximum 15 files
2. WHEN completing each batch THEN the system SHALL validate TypeScript compilation success
3. WHEN a batch causes compilation errors THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback changes using git stash
4. WHEN processing high-impact files THEN the system SHALL apply enhanced safety protocols with smaller batch sizes
5. WHEN encountering critical system files THEN the system SHALL require manual review before processing

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Variable Transformation

**User Story:** As a developer maximizing code value, I want some unused variables to be transformed into functional features rather than eliminated, so that code provides maximum enterprise value.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system finds clusters of related unused variables THEN it SHALL suggest transformation into functional components
2. WHEN unused variables represent incomplete features THEN the system SHALL offer completion rather than elimination
3. WHEN variables have high semantic value THEN the system SHALL prefer prefixing (UNUSED_, _variable) over elimination
4. WHEN processing service layer variables THEN the system SHALL consider activation into monitoring or intelligence features
5. WHEN handling data processing variables THEN the system SHALL evaluate transformation into validation or quality systems

### Requirement 5: Progress Tracking and Reporting

**User Story:** As a project manager monitoring code quality improvements, I want detailed progress tracking of unused variable elimination, so that I can measure campaign effectiveness and ROI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the elimination process starts THEN the system SHALL establish baseline metrics (624 unused variables)
2. WHEN processing batches THEN the system SHALL track variables eliminated, preserved, and transformed
3. WHEN completing phases THEN the system SHALL generate progress reports with percentage reductions
4. WHEN encountering issues THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and recovery actions
5. WHEN the campaign completes THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive achievement metrics and ROI analysis

### Requirement 6: Build Stability and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining production systems, I want unused variable elimination to maintain perfect build stability, so that the codebase remains deployable throughout the cleanup process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any batch processing occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain zero TypeScript compilation errors
2. WHEN changes are applied THEN the system SHALL validate that all tests continue to pass
3. WHEN processing React components THEN the system SHALL ensure component functionality is preserved
4. WHEN handling service integrations THEN the system SHALL verify API endpoints remain functional
5. WHEN completing the campaign THEN the system SHALL achieve 90% unused variable reduction while maintaining 100% build stability
