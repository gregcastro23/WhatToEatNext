# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic improvement of our ESLint configuration and the elimination of all remaining linting issues in the WhatToEatNext codebase. Currently, we have 5,749 total linting issues (242 errors + 5,507 warnings) that need to be systematically resolved while maintaining code quality and functionality.

The goal is to achieve a pristine codebase with zero linting errors and warnings, implementing enterprise-grade code quality standards that align with our astrological application's requirements for precision and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: ESLint Configuration Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a perfectly configured ESLint setup that catches all relevant issues while avoiding false positives, so that our code quality remains consistently high.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ESLint configuration is updated THEN it SHALL include all necessary plugins for TypeScript, React, and import resolution
2. WHEN running ESLint THEN it SHALL properly resolve all TypeScript path mappings and module imports
3. WHEN ESLint analyzes the codebase THEN it SHALL distinguish between different file types (components, tests, scripts) with appropriate rule sets
4. WHEN ESLint encounters astrological calculation files THEN it SHALL apply domain-specific rules that preserve calculation accuracy
5. WHEN the configuration is applied THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with Prettier for consistent formatting

### Requirement 2: Systematic Error Elimination

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all ESLint errors systematically resolved without breaking existing functionality, so that our build process is stable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint errors are fixed THEN the build process SHALL continue to work without issues
2. WHEN unused variables are addressed THEN critical astrological calculations SHALL remain intact
3. WHEN import issues are resolved THEN all module dependencies SHALL be properly maintained
4. WHEN type safety issues are fixed THEN TypeScript compilation SHALL complete successfully
5. WHEN console statements are addressed THEN debugging capabilities SHALL be preserved where appropriate

### Requirement 3: Warning Resolution Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all ESLint warnings systematically addressed through appropriate fixes or rule adjustments, so that our codebase maintains the highest quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN explicit `any` types are encountered THEN they SHALL be replaced with proper TypeScript types or marked as intentional
2. WHEN unused variables are detected THEN they SHALL be removed or prefixed with underscore if intentionally unused
3. WHEN import/export issues are found THEN they SHALL be resolved through proper module organization
4. WHEN React hooks dependency warnings occur THEN they SHALL be addressed without breaking component functionality
5. WHEN formatting inconsistencies are detected THEN they SHALL be automatically resolved through Prettier integration

### Requirement 4: Domain-Specific Rule Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer working on astrological calculations, I want ESLint rules that understand our domain-specific patterns, so that linting doesn't interfere with astronomical precision requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint analyzes astrological calculation files THEN it SHALL allow necessary mathematical constants and fallback values
2. WHEN processing planetary position data THEN it SHALL understand the required data structures and validation patterns
3. WHEN examining elemental property calculations THEN it SHALL respect the four-element system requirements
4. WHEN analyzing campaign system files THEN it SHALL accommodate the enterprise intelligence patterns
5. WHEN reviewing test files THEN it SHALL apply appropriate testing-specific rule relaxations

### Requirement 5: Performance and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the linting process to be fast and maintainable, so that it integrates smoothly into our development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint runs on the full codebase THEN it SHALL complete within 30 seconds
2. WHEN incremental linting occurs during development THEN it SHALL provide immediate feedback
3. WHEN new files are added THEN they SHALL automatically inherit appropriate linting rules
4. WHEN the configuration is updated THEN it SHALL be easily maintainable and well-documented
5. WHEN integration with CI/CD occurs THEN it SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages

### Requirement 6: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the linting system to integrate seamlessly with our existing campaign system and development tools, so that code quality improvements are automated and tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the campaign system runs THEN it SHALL track linting improvements as quality metrics
2. WHEN build processes execute THEN they SHALL include linting validation as a quality gate
3. WHEN development tools are used THEN they SHALL provide consistent linting feedback
4. WHEN code reviews occur THEN they SHALL have automated linting validation
5. WHEN deployment processes run THEN they SHALL require zero linting issues as a prerequisite
