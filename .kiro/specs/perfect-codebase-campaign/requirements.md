# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Perfect Codebase Campaign is a systematic excellence initiative to transform the WhatToEatNext project into a production-ready codebase with zero TypeScript errors, zero linting warnings, and enterprise-grade intelligence systems. This campaign leverages proven methodologies from 24 successful error elimination campaigns and builds upon existing achievements including 98.3% overall error reduction and 100% build stability maintenance.

The campaign addresses the final 86 TypeScript errors, 4,506 linting warnings, and transforms 523 unused exports into active enterprise intelligence systems while maintaining sub-10 second build times and achieving 100% test coverage.

5. WHEN analyzing error distribution THEN the system SHALL eliminate all TS2304 and TS2362 errors (currently ~7)
6. WHEN applying systematic fixes THEN the system SHALL maintain 100% build stability throughout the process
7. WHEN processing files in batches THEN the system SHALL process 5-25 files per run with safety monitoring
8. IF corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback using git stash

### Requirement 2: Linting Excellence Achievement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want zero linting warnings, so that the codebase maintains perfect code quality standards and follows all best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running linting checks THEN the system SHALL produce zero warnings
2. WHEN analyzing explicit-any warnings THEN the system SHALL eliminate all 624 remaining @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any warnings

5. WHEN processing linting fixes THEN the system SHALL continue the proven 75.5% explicit-any reduction campaign methodology
6. WHEN applying linting fixes THEN the system SHALL use systematic warning elimination with batch processing
7. IF linting fixes cause build failures THEN the system SHALL rollback and retry with smaller batches

### Requirement 3: Enterprise Intelligence Transformation

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want all unused exports transformed into active enterprise intelligence systems, so that the codebase maximizes its analytical capabilities and eliminates technical debt.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing unused exports THEN the system SHALL transform all 523 modules with unused exports into active systems
2. WHEN prioritizing transformations THEN the system SHALL process 120 high-priority recipe building files first
3. WHEN prioritizing transformations THEN the system SHALL process 180 medium-priority core system files second
4. WHEN prioritizing transformations THEN the system SHALL process 42 low-priority external/test files last
5. WHEN transforming exports THEN the system SHALL create intelligence systems with analytics, recommendations, and demonstration capabilities
6. WHEN completing transformations THEN the system SHALL achieve 200+ additional active enterprise systems
7. WHEN applying transformations THEN the system SHALL maintain 100% build stability as proven in previous campaigns

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized build performance under 10 seconds, so that development workflow remains efficient while achieving perfect code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL complete compilation in under 10 seconds
2. WHEN monitoring cache performance THEN the system SHALL maintain 80%+ cache hit rate
3. WHEN monitoring memory usage THEN the system SHALL keep memory consumption under 50MB
4. WHEN optimizing bundles THEN the system SHALL maintain the 420kB target bundle size
5. WHEN applying performance optimizations THEN the system SHALL use the proven 3-tier caching system
6. WHEN implementing lazy loading THEN the system SHALL use selective data fetching patterns
7. IF build time exceeds 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL identify and optimize performance bottlenecks

### Requirement 5: Safety Protocol Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive safety protocols during the campaign execution, so that all changes can be safely applied and rolled back if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting any fix operation THEN the system SHALL require a dry-run execution first
2. WHEN applying fixes THEN the system SHALL create git stashes with descriptive names before each operation
3. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL validate TypeScript compilation after every batch
4. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL validate build success after every batch
5. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL validate test execution after every batch
6. IF corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically restore from the appropriate git stash
7. WHEN completing each phase THEN the system SHALL create milestone commits with progress tracking
8. IF emergency rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear restoration commands for each script type

### Requirement 6: Progress Tracking and Validation

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want comprehensive progress tracking and validation metrics, so that campaign success can be measured and verified at each milestone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking TypeScript errors THEN the system SHALL provide real-time error count using `yarn tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck 2>&1 | grep -c "error TS"`
2. WHEN tracking linting warnings THEN the system SHALL provide real-time warning count using `yarn lint 2>&1 | grep -c "warning"`
3. WHEN tracking build performance THEN the system SHALL measure and report build time using `time yarn build`
4. WHEN tracking enterprise systems THEN the system SHALL count active intelligence systems using `grep -r "INTELLIGENCE_SYSTEM" src/ | wc -l`
5. WHEN completing Phase 1 THEN the system SHALL validate zero TypeScript errors achieved
6. WHEN completing Phase 2 THEN the system SHALL validate zero linting warnings achieved
7. WHEN completing Phase 3 THEN the system SHALL validate all exports transformed to enterprise systems
8. WHEN completing Phase 4 THEN the system SHALL validate perfect performance and test coverage achieved

### Requirement 7: Campaign Execution Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a systematic execution framework with proven tools and methodologies, so that the campaign can be executed efficiently using battle-tested approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria
