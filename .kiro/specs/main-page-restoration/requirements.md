# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on restoring and optimizing the main page functionality of the "What To Eat Next" application, leveraging the fully optimized Kiro workspace configuration. The main page serves as the central hub where users interact with mini versions of key recommender components, debug tools, and navigation to full-featured pages. 

With the Kiro optimization complete (100% validation success), we now have enhanced development capabilities including:
- Comprehensive steering file guidance for astrological calculations
- Automated agent hooks for data validation and quality assurance
- Optimized MCP server integration for external APIs
- Enhanced TypeScript and React development experience

The goal is to ensure the main page loads correctly with all essential components working together seamlessly, providing real-time astrological data and debugging capabilities while maintaining the highest code quality standards established by the optimization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Main Page Loading and Stability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the main page to load without errors, so that I can access all the core functionality of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the main page SHALL load without JavaScript errors
2. WHEN the main page loads THEN all essential components SHALL render without breaking the page
3. IF a component fails to load THEN error boundaries SHALL prevent the entire page from crashing
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the layout SHALL be responsive and properly structured

### Requirement 2: Debug Component Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consolidated debug components in the bottom right of the page, so that I can monitor real-time data and debug components effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main page loads THEN debug components SHALL be visible in the bottom right corner
2. WHEN debug components are active THEN they SHALL display real-time astrological and system data
3. WHEN debug components are toggled THEN they SHALL show/hide without affecting other components
4. WHEN debug data updates THEN the display SHALL reflect changes in real-time
5. IF debug components encounter errors THEN they SHALL fail gracefully without breaking the main page

### Requirement 3: Cuisine Recommender Component

**User Story:** As a user, I want a cuisine recommender on the main page, so that I can get cuisine suggestions with nested recipe and sauce recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main page loads THEN the cuisine recommender SHALL display available cuisines
2. WHEN a cuisine is selected THEN nested recipe recommendations SHALL appear
3. WHEN a recipe is selected THEN sauce recommendations SHALL be available
4. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN they SHALL be based on current astrological data
5. IF the recommender fails THEN it SHALL display a fallback message without breaking the page

### Requirement 4: Ingredient Recommender Component

**User Story:** As a user, I want an ingredient recommender with expandable cards, so that I can explore ingredients with their culinary properties organized by categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main page loads THEN the ingredient recommender SHALL display ingredient categories
2. WHEN a category is selected THEN relevant ingredients SHALL be displayed as cards
3. WHEN an ingredient card is clicked THEN it SHALL expand to show culinary data
4. WHEN ingredient cards are expanded THEN they SHALL display properties like flavor profiles, cooking methods, and nutritional information
5. WHEN ingredients are recommended THEN they SHALL be filtered based on current astrological influences

### Requirement 5: Cooking Methods Section Component

**User Story:** As a user, I want a cooking methods section on the main page, so that I can see recommended cooking methods and navigate to the full cooking methods page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main page loads THEN the cooking methods section SHALL display recommended methods
2. WHEN cooking methods are displayed THEN they SHALL be relevant to current astrological conditions
3. WHEN a cooking method is selected THEN additional details SHALL be available
4. WHEN the "View More" option is clicked THEN it SHALL navigate to the full cooking methods page
5. IF no methods are available THEN a default set SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 6: Recipe Builder Component Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want a working recipe builder component, so that I can create custom recipes based on recommended ingredients and methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main page loads THEN the recipe builder SHALL be accessible
2. WHEN ingredients are added to the builder THEN they SHALL persist in the current session
3. WHEN cooking methods are selected THEN they SHALL integrate with the ingredient selections
4. WHEN a recipe is built THEN it SHALL provide cooking instructions and timing
5. WHEN the recipe is complete THEN it SHALL be saveable or shareable

### Requirement 7: Component Integration and Data Flow

**User Story:** As a user, I want all main page components to work together seamlessly, so that I have a cohesive experience when exploring food recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components load THEN they SHALL share astrological context data
2. WHEN one component updates THEN related components SHALL reflect relevant changes
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN component states SHALL be preserved appropriately
4. WHEN data is fetched THEN loading states SHALL be displayed consistently across components
5. IF network requests fail THEN components SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 8: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the main page to load quickly and respond smoothly, so that I can efficiently explore food recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN initial render SHALL complete within 3 seconds
2. WHEN components update THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and responsive
3. WHEN multiple components are active THEN the page SHALL maintain good performance
4. WHEN data is loading THEN appropriate loading indicators SHALL be shown
5. WHEN errors occur THEN user-friendly error messages SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 9: Navigation and Page Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate from main page components to their full-featured pages, so that I can access detailed functionality when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN component links are clicked THEN navigation SHALL work to full pages (ingredients page, cooking methods page)
2. WHEN navigating to full pages THEN context from main page selections SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN returning to main page THEN previous states SHALL be restored appropriately
4. WHEN navigation occurs THEN it SHALL be smooth without page refresh
5. IF navigation fails THEN fallback options SHALL be available

### Requirement 10: Enhanced Development Experience and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the main page restoration to leverage the optimized Kiro workspace capabilities, so that development is efficient and code quality is maintained automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing components THEN Kiro steering files SHALL provide contextual guidance for astrological calculations
2. WHEN modifying astrological data THEN agent hooks SHALL automatically validate planetary positions and elemental properties
3. WHEN TypeScript errors exceed thresholds THEN automated campaigns SHALL trigger to maintain code quality
4. WHEN external APIs are used THEN MCP server integration SHALL provide reliable fallback mechanisms
5. IF code quality issues are detected THEN automated validation tools SHALL provide immediate feedback
