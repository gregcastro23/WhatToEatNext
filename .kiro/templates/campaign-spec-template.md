### Error Categorization and Prioritization
[Define how the campaign categorizes and prioritizes errors:]

#### High-Priority Error Categories
- **Critical Build Failures**: Errors that prevent compilation or deployment
- **Type Safety Violations**: TypeScript errors that compromise type safety
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Code patterns that introduce security risks
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Code that significantly impacts system performance

#### Error Impact Assessment

- **Fix Success Rate**: Historical success rate for different error types
- **Downstream Impact**: How fixing one error affects related code
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential risks of automated fixes

#### Prioritization Matrix
```typescript
interface ErrorPriority {
  errorType: string;
  frequency: number;
  impact: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  fixSuccessRate: number;
  automationSafety: 'safe' | 'moderate' | 'risky';
  priority: number; // 1-10 scale
}
```
