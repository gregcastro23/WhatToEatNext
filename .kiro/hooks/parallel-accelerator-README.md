### **Medium Priority Tasks**

3. **Build System Repair** (60s)
   - Repairs missing manifest files
   - Optimizes build configuration
   - Validates build health

4. **Docker Health Check** (20s)
   - Comprehensive Docker optimization
   - Container health validation
   - Performance tuning

### **Low Priority Tasks**

5. **Test Memory Optimization** (15s)
   - Configures Jest memory settings

6. **Planetary Data Validation** (25s)
   - Refreshes astrological data cache
   - Validates transit dates
   - Ensures calculation accuracy

## System Health Scoring

The hook continuously monitors system health across multiple dimensions:

- **TypeScript Health** (30 points): Error count and compilation status
- **Linting Health** (25 points): Warning count and code quality
- **Build Health** (25 points): Build system stability
- **Docker Health** (20 points): Container environment status

**Health Status Levels:**

- **90-100**: Excellent - System running optimally
- **70-89**: Good - Minor issues, stable operation
- **50-69**: Warning - Attention needed, some instability
- **0-49**: Critical - Immediate intervention required

## Docker Optimizations

### **Automatic Enhancements**

- Adds development environment variables:
  - `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true`
  - `WATCHPACK_POLLING=true`
  - `FAST_REFRESH=true`
  - `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=2048`

### **Performance Tuning**

- Optimizes memory allocation
- Enables efficient file watching
- Configures API caching
- Disables telemetry for faster builds

### **Health Check Integration**

- Creates `/api/health` endpoint automatically
- Monitors container uptime and memory
- Provides deployment readiness status

## Integration with Your Current Workflow

### **Seamless TypeScript Error Reduction**

While you work on fixing TypeScript errors with Claude, this hook:

- Continuously optimizes imports and code quality
- Maintains build system health
- Ensures Docker environment stability
- Provides real-time progress metrics

### **Maximizes Parallel Utilization**

- Runs improvement tasks while you focus on core issues
- Prevents resource conflicts through intelligent scheduling
- Maintains system stability during intensive development

### **Docker Robustness**

- Ensures containers are always ready for testing
- Optimizes development environment performance
- Maintains production deployment readiness

## Execution Schedule

**Trigger**: Every 3 minutes (180 seconds) **Max Executions**: 20 per hour
**Background Execution**: Yes **Auto-retry**: Up to 2 attempts on failure

## Monitoring and Reporting

### **Real-time Logs**

- `logs/parallel-acceleration/task-successes.log`
- `logs/parallel-acceleration/task-failures.log`
- `logs/parallel-acceleration/acceleration-errors.log`

### **Progress Reports**

- `.kiro/parallel-reports/latest-acceleration.json`
- `.kiro/parallel-reports/acceleration-[timestamp].json`

### **Metrics Tracked**

- Tasks completed per session
- Code quality improvements
- Build system enhancements
- Docker optimizations applied
- System health score progression
