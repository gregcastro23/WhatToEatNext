BCE, with evidence of oil-cooking vessels and depictions in tomb paintings. The technique spread throughout the Mediterranean and was later refined in Asia and Europe. Deep-frying became especially popular during medieval times in Europe, while tempura was introduced to Japan by Portuguese traders in the 16th century. Modern industrialization in the 20th century, particularly the rise of fast-food chains, has made fried foods a global phenomenon. Throughout the centuries, different cultures developed unique approaches—from the light tempura batters of Japan to the seasoned cornmeal coatings of Southern American cuisine.
