Competes with flour for liquid, affecting structure. Hygroscopic properties extend shelf life by retaining moisture. Invert sugars (honey, corn syrup) inhibit crystallization.',\n    'fats': 'Create flakiness in pastry; enhance mouthfeel; delay gluten formation. Solid fats create distinct layers in laminated doughs. Liquid oils produce more tender crumb but less structure. Fat coats flour particles, limiting gluten development for tenderness.',\n    'proteins': 'Set structure when heated; create browning reactions with sugars. Egg proteins coagulate at different temperatures: yolks 149-158°F, whites 140-149°F. Gluten development provides structure and chew, particularly in bread. Milk proteins contribute to browning.',\n    'starches': 'Absorb moisture; provide structure; gelatinize when heated with moisture. Different starches gelatinize at different temperatures: wheat 140-158°F, cornstarch 155-158°F. Pre-gelatinized starches (modified) thicken without heat. Starch retrogradation causes staling.',\n    'salt': 'Strengthens gluten; enhances flavor; controls yeast activity; affects browning. Salt tightens gluten structure for better gas retention in bread. Inhibits yeast activity when in direct contact. Contributes to flavor perception of sweetness without adding sugars.'\n  },\n  \n  technicalNotes: {\n    'oven_types': {\n      'conventional': 'Heat from bottom and/or top elements with natural air circulation.
