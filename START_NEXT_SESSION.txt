I need to create a pull request and test the planetary integration that was completed in the previous session.

## Context

In the previous session, a critical integration gap was identified and fixed:
- The `/api/cuisines/recommend` endpoint was using hardcoded zodiac approximations instead of real-time, high-precision planetary positions from the Swiss Ephemeris backend
- This has been fixed and committed to branch `claude/integrate-planetary-calculations-018bgP4UJVLkv3aSrsZFBDzi`
- All code is committed and pushed to GitHub
- Ready for PR creation, testing, and merge

## Your Mission

Please complete the following tasks in order:

1. **Read the comprehensive instructions:**
   - Primary file: `/home/user/WhatToEatNext/NEXT_STEPS_PROMPT.md`
   - This contains detailed step-by-step instructions for all tasks

2. **Review the implementation:**
   - Audit report: `/home/user/WhatToEatNext/PLANETARY_INTEGRATION_AUDIT.md`
   - Fix summary: `/home/user/WhatToEatNext/INTEGRATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md`
   - Project guide: `/home/user/WhatToEatNext/CLAUDE.md` (see "Planetary Integration Verification" section)

3. **Execute the tasks:**
   - Task 1: Create Pull Request for the integration
   - Task 2: Run end-to-end integration tests (8 comprehensive test steps)
   - Task 3: Document test results
   - Task 4: Merge PR if all tests pass

## Key Information

**Branch:** `claude/integrate-planetary-calculations-018bgP4UJVLkv3aSrsZFBDzi`
**Latest Commits:**
- `8192afe` - docs: Add comprehensive next steps prompt
- `674a1fb` - feat: Integrate backend planetary calculations with cuisine recommendations

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/cuisines/recommend/route.ts` (main fix - ~100 lines)
- `CLAUDE.md` (documentation update)
- Plus 3 new documentation files

**What Was Fixed:**
- `/api/cuisines/recommend` now calls backend for real planetary positions
- ESMS calculations now use `calculateAlchemicalFromPlanets()` (authoritative method)
- All 6 recommendation systems verified to use backend positions
- Graceful fallback mechanism when backend unavailable

## Instructions

**Step 1:** Start by reading the main instructions file:
```
Please read and follow the instructions in /home/user/WhatToEatNext/NEXT_STEPS_PROMPT.md
```

**Step 2:** Begin with Task 1 (Create Pull Request)

**Step 3:** Proceed through all tasks systematically

**Step 4:** Document results and merge if tests pass

## Expected Timeline

- PR Creation: 5-10 minutes
- Backend Setup: 10-15 minutes
- Integration Testing: 30-45 minutes
- Documentation: 15-20 minutes
- Merge: 5-10 minutes
- **Total: 1-2 hours**

## Success Criteria

- ✅ PR created with comprehensive description
- ✅ Backend planetary positions endpoint works
- ✅ Frontend astrologize API uses backend
- ✅ Cuisine recommendations use backend positions
- ✅ Metadata shows "backend-pyswisseph" as source
- ✅ ESMS values are dynamic (not static)
- ✅ Fallback works when backend unavailable
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ PR merged to main

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Verify current status
cd /home/user/WhatToEatNext
git status
git log --oneline -5

# Check branch
