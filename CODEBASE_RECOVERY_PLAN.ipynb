## 🔥 Phase 27: Production Deployment & Build Optimization (September 24, 2025)

### 🎯 **PHASE 27B: ERROR ELIMINATION CAMPAIGN - IN PROGRESS**

**Current Status:** Active systematic error reduction campaign
**Baseline Errors:** ~30,040 TypeScript errors
**Current Errors:** 29,982 errors
**Progress:** 58 errors eliminated (0.19% reduction)
**Target:** Reduce to <1,000 errors for Phase 27C

### Systematic Error Elimination Strategy

**Priority Targeting:**
1. **Data Files**: High-error ingredient/cuisine data files (seafood.ts: 832→827, indian.ts: 441→440)
2. **Service Files**: Complex enterprise services (EnterpriseIntelligenceIntegration.ts: 688→684)
3. **Calculation Files**: Core engine syntax fixes (combinationEffects.ts: ~1 error, alchemicalEngine.ts: 0 errors)

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ **combinationEffects.ts**: Fixed syntax corruption, reduced to ~1 error
- ✅ **alchemicalEngine.ts**: Complete syntax cleanup, 0 errors achieved
- ✅ **seafood.ts**: Fixed export syntax corruption, reduced from 832 to 827 errors
- ✅ **indian.ts**: Fixed declaration and property syntax, reduced from 441 to 440 errors
- ✅ **EnterpriseIntelligenceIntegration.ts**: Fixed interface/property syntax, reduced from 688 to 684 errors

### Current Error Distribution (Top 10 Files)
