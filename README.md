# WhatToEatNext

A sophisticated culinary recommendation system that uses alchemical principles, astrological data, and elemental harmony to suggest personalized recipes, ingredients, and cooking methods tailored to your cosmic alignment and preferences.

## Core Philosophy

### Elemental Harmony Approach

Our system is based on the principle that all four elements (Fire, Water, Earth, Air) are individually valuable and contribute unique qualities. Rather than viewing elements as opposing forces, we recognize that:

- Each element brings its own distinctive qualities
- Elements reinforce themselves (like strengthens like)
- All element combinations work harmoniously together
- Elements are appreciated for their individual contributions, not for "balancing" each other

## Key Features

- **Personalized Recipe Recommendations**: Curated suggestions based on your astrological profile
- **Ingredient Affinity Calculator**: Discover ideal ingredient pairings based on elemental harmony
- **Cooking Method Advisor**: Recommendations using our 14 Alchemical Pillars system
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Food recommendations that shift with the wheel of the year
- **Cuisine Explorer**: Browse culinary traditions through their elemental properties
- **Sauce Recommendation Engine**: Find the perfect sauce pairing for any dish
- **Chakra-Influenced Food Selections**: Align your meals with energetic centers

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS
- **Astrological Calculations**: Astronomia library with local ephemeris data
- **Component Libraries**: Astro for astrological visualizations

## Alchemical Pillars System

Our application maps traditional cooking methods to 14 alchemical transformation processes (Calcination, Fermentation, Distillation, etc.), providing nuanced cooking recommendations that honor ancient wisdom.

Each pillar affects the four alchemical properties (Spirit, Essence, Matter, and Substance) differently, creating a sophisticated framework for understanding culinary transformations.
