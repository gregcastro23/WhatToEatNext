## Key Insights and Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 24-48 hours)
1. **Execute Console Statement Cleanup** - 3,340 warnings can be automated
2. **Apply Variable Declaration Fixes** - Use ESLint --fix for prefer-const/no-var
3. **Organize Import Statements** - Automated import sorting

### Strategic Insights
1. **High Automation Potential:** 51% of warnings (console statements) can be fully automated
2. **Type Safety Challenge:** 47% of warnings require careful manual review for type improvements
3. **Domain Preservation Critical:** Astrological calculations require expert review for any type changes
4. **Quick Wins Available:** Immediate 50%+ reduction possible through automation
