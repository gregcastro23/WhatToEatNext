# Makefile Build System Repair Commands

## Overview

The Makefile has been enhanced with comprehensive build system repair commands
that integrate with the build system repair utilities. These commands provide
easy access to validation, repair, and monitoring functionality.

## Build System Repair Commands

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Validate build system health
make build-validate

# Repair missing or corrupted manifest files
make build-repair

# Check comprehensive build system health status
make build-health

# Run comprehensive build system repair
make build-comprehensive

# Quick repair for common issues
make build-quick

# Rebuild with error recovery mechanisms
make build-rebuild

# Emergency build recovery (cleans and rebuilds)
make build-emergency
```

### Workflow Commands

```bash
# Complete build system workflow (health → validate → repair → validate)
make build-workflow

# Comprehensive status report with health and validation
make build-status

# Monitor build system health with tips
make build-monitor

# Safe build with automatic repair integration
make build-safe
```

## Command Details

### `make build-validate`

- **Purpose**: Validates build system and checks for issues
- **Output**: Reports missing files, corrupted files, and validation status
- **Use Case**: Quick check before builds or deployments

### `make build-repair`

- **Purpose**: Repairs missing or corrupted manifest files
- **Output**: Creates missing files with minimal valid content
- **Use Case**: Fix build issues without full rebuild

### `make build-health`

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive health check with metrics
- **Output**: Build existence, manifest validity, size, and last build time
- **Use Case**: Regular monitoring and troubleshooting

### `make build-comprehensive`

- **Purpose**: Full build system repair including config optimization
- **Output**: Step-by-step repair process with rebuild
- **Use Case**: Major build issues or after significant changes

### `make build-emergency`

- **Purpose**: Emergency recovery with clean rebuild
- **Output**: Cleans build directory and performs fresh build
- **Use Case**: Critical build failures or corruption

### `make build-workflow`

- **Purpose**: Complete workflow for build system maintenance
- **Steps**:
  1. Health check
  2. Validation
  3. Repair if needed
  4. Final validation
- **Use Case**: Regular maintenance or CI/CD integration

### `make build-status`

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive status report
- **Output**: Health report, validation results, and recent build activity
- **Use Case**: Debugging and status reporting

### `make build-safe`

- **Purpose**: Safe build with integrated repair
- **Steps**:
  1. Pre-build health check
  2. Validation
  3. Quick repair
  4. TypeScript compilation check
  5. Production build
  6. Post-build validation
- **Use Case**: Production builds with safety checks

## Integration with Existing Workflow

### Enhanced Development Workflow

```bash
# Traditional workflow
make check → make build → make test → make deploy

# Enhanced workflow with build system repair
make build-health → make check → make build-safe → make test → make deploy
```

### CI/CD Integration

```bash
# Pre-deployment validation
make build-workflow
make check
make test
make build-safe
```

### Troubleshooting Workflow

```bash
# When build fails
make build-health        # Check what's wrong
make build-comprehensive # Fix comprehensively
make build-validate      # Confirm fix
```

## Error Scenarios and Solutions

### Scenario 1: Missing Manifest Files

```bash
# Symptoms: Build fails with missing manifest errors
# Solution:
make build-repair
```

### Scenario 2: Corrupted Build Directory

```bash
# Symptoms: Build exists but validation fails
# Solution:
make build-comprehensive
```

### Scenario 3: Critical Build Failure

```bash
# Symptoms: Build completely broken
# Solution:
make build-emergency
```

### Scenario 4: Unknown Build Issues

```bash
# Diagnostic workflow:
make build-status        # Get comprehensive status
make build-health        # Check specific health metrics
make build-comprehensive # Apply comprehensive fix
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Health Checks

```bash
# Daily health check
make build-health

# Weekly comprehensive check
make build-workflow
```

### Pre-deployment Validation

```bash
# Before important deployments
make build-status
make build-safe
```

### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# After git pull or environment changes
make build-validate
make build-repair  # if needed
```

## Output Examples

### Healthy Build System

```bash
$ make build-health
🏥 Checking build system health...

📊 Health Report (2025-07-18T04:04:06.184Z):
  Build exists: ✅
  Manifests valid: ✅
  Build size: 1623.95 MB
  Last build: 2025-07-18T04:00:28.776Z
```

### Build System with Issues

```bash
$ make build-validate
🔍 Validating build system...
❌ Build system has issues:
  Missing files: 3
  Corrupted files: 1

📁 Missing files:
  - .next/server/pages-manifest.json
  - .next/server/middleware-manifest.json
  - .next/build-manifest.json
```

### Successful Repair

```bash
$ make build-repair
🔧 Repairing build system...
Created pages-manifest.json
Created middleware-manifest.json
Created build-manifest.json
✅ Build repair completed
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Monitoring

- Run `make build-health` daily
- Include `make build-validate` in pre-commit hooks
- Use `make build-workflow` for comprehensive checks

### 2. Proactive Repair

- Run `make build-repair` after major changes
- Use `make build-comprehensive` monthly
- Include build validation in CI/CD pipelines

### 3. Emergency Preparedness

- Know when to use `make build-emergency`
- Keep `make build-status` handy for debugging
- Document build issues and solutions

### 4. Integration with Development

- Use `make build-safe` for production builds
- Include build health in development workflow
- Monitor build size and performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

```bash
# Ensure you're in the project root directory
pwd  # Should show project root
make help  # Should show all available commands
```

### Permission Issues

```bash
# Ensure proper file permissions
chmod +x scripts/build-system-repair.cjs
```

### Node.js/Yarn Issues

```bash
# Ensure dependencies are installed
make install
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be >= 20.18.0
```
