# Zodiac Sign String Literal to Enum Conversion

## Problem

Throughout the codebase, many instances of string literals were being used to represent zodiac signs, instead of using the `ZodiacSign` enum from `src/types/constants.ts`. This creates several issues:

1. **Type Safety**: String literals don't provide type checking, leading to potential runtime errors
2. **Consistency**: Different casing and formats might be used (e.g., "Aries" vs "aries")
3. **Maintenance**: Changes to zodiac sign representation require updates in multiple places
4. **IDE Support**: Using enums provides better autocomplete and documentation

For example, code like this was common:

```typescript
favorableZodiac: ['aries', 'leo', 'sagittarius']
```

Instead of using the properly typed enum values:

```typescript
favorableZodiac: [ZodiacSign.Aries, ZodiacSign.Leo, ZodiacSign.Sagittarius]
```

## Solution

To solve this issue, we've implemented:

1. A comprehensive script that automatically converts string literals to enum values across the codebase
2. Updates to critical files where explicit conversion was needed

The script `fixZodiacSignLiterals.ts` scans TypeScript files for:
- Arrays with zodiac sign string literals
- Individual string literals that represent zodiac signs
- Properties like `favorableZodiac`, `unfavorableZodiac`, etc.

It then converts them to use the `ZodiacSign` enum from `src/types/constants.ts` and updates the imports as needed.

## Using the Script

To run the automated conversion:

```bash
yarn fix-zodiac-signs
```

This will:
1. Scan all TypeScript files in the src directory
2. Convert string literals to enum values where appropriate
3. Add necessary imports for `ZodiacSign`
4. Report the number of files modified

## Manual Conversion Guide

If you need to manually convert zodiac sign string literals:

1. Add the import if not already present:
   ```typescript
   import { ZodiacSign } from '../types/constants';
   ```

2. Replace string literals with enum values:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   const sign = 'aries';
   
   // After
   const sign = ZodiacSign.Aries;
   ```

3. For arrays:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   const signs = ['aries', 'taurus', 'gemini'];
   
   // After
   const signs = [ZodiacSign.Aries, ZodiacSign.Taurus, ZodiacSign.Gemini];
   ```

## Key Files Updated

The following key files have been updated as examples:

- `src/utils/elementalMappings/ingredients.ts`: All favorableZodiac arrays
- `src/constants/zodiac.ts`: Removed duplicate type definition and updated references
- `src/calculations/culinaryAstrology.ts`: Updated zodiacMatch method

## Considerations

When working with zodiac signs:

- Always use the `ZodiacSign` enum from `src/types/constants.ts`
- If mapping to elements or other properties, use computed property syntax: `[ZodiacSign.Aries]: 'Fire'`
- For type definitions, use `ZodiacSign` rather than string literals
- For parameters that accept zodiac signs, type them with `ZodiacSign`

## Testing

After conversion, run the test suite to ensure all functionality works as expected:

```bash
yarn test
```
