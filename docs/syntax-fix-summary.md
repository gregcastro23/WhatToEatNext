# Syntax Error Fixes for alchemicalEngine.ts

## Summary

We successfully fixed all syntax errors in the `src/calculations/alchemicalEngine.ts` file, which was the primary source of TypeScript syntax errors in the codebase. This document outlines the specific fixes applied.

## Approach

We created three specialized scripts to systematically address different types of syntax errors:

1. `fix-final-syntax-errors.js` - Fixed basic syntax errors like missing parentheses and braces
2. `fix-remaining-syntax-errors.js` - Addressed more complex issues like JSON.parse and missing constants
3. `fix-specific-syntax-errors.js` - Targeted very specific syntax errors identified during testing

## Specific Fixes

### 1. Missing Parentheses
- Fixed missing closing parentheses in if statements around lines 1336-1342
- Fixed missing closing parenthesis in switch statements around line 1382
- Fixed missing parentheses in element checks around lines 1415-1418
- Fixed missing closing parenthesis in function calls around line 1470
- Fixed missing closing parentheses in type checks around lines 1524, 1828

### 2. Object Structure Issues
- Fixed missing commas in object properties around lines 1996, 2040
- Fixed object literals with incorrect structure at lines 2039-2054
- Fixed incorrectly structured object literals with misplaced braces

### 3. Type Definition Issues
- Added missing constants `planetInfo`, `signInfo`, and `signs` required for JSON.parse calls
- Fixed duplicate function definitions (removed duplicate `getAbsoluteElementValue` function)

### 4. Other Fixes
- Corrected the parentheses structure in conditional logic at line 1985
- Fixed property access syntax in object literals

## Results

After applying these fixes, the TypeScript compiler can now parse the file without syntax errors. While there are still type-related errors in the codebase, all syntax errors in this file have been resolved.

## Next Steps

The remaining errors in the codebase are primarily type-related issues rather than syntax errors. These include:

1. Property access on unknowns
2. Type mismatches between interfaces
3. Missing type definitions
4. Incorrect type assignments

These issues can be addressed separately as they do not prevent the TypeScript compiler from parsing the files.

## Scripts Created

The scripts we created are reusable for similar syntax fixes in the future and follow the project's standards:

- ES modules format
- Dry run capability
- Focused on specific problems rather than broad fixes
- Non-destructive approach that preserves code functionality
