## 🎯 **PROMPT FOR AI ASSISTANT**

**Please continue Phase 3 of the DATA_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md by implementing Step
4 (Nutritional Data Enhancement). Start by:**

1. **Analyzing the current nutritional data files** to understand existing
   functionality and structure
2. **Examining existing nutritional profiles** and how they can be enhanced with
   alchemical principles
3. **Creating a unified nutritional system** that integrates Monica constants
   and Kalchm values
4. **Implementing alchemical nutritional categorization** (spirit, essence,
   matter, substance nutrients)
5. **Integrating with all unified systems** (seasonal, cuisine, ingredients,
   recipes) for comprehensive nutritional intelligence
6. **Creating comprehensive tests** to validate the nutritional enhancement
7. **Ensuring backward compatibility** with existing nutritional services

**Focus on leveraging the existing nutritional data structure, planetary
nutritional correlations, and the completed unified systems (seasonal, cuisine,
ingredients, recipes) to create intelligent nutritional recommendations that
follow elemental self-reinforcement principles and provide
Monica/Kalchm-optimized nutrition.**

**Use the successful recipe building enhancement as a template and maintain the
high-quality standards established in previous implementations.**
