## 📋 Checklist for Chat 1 ✅ COMPLETED

### **Critical Path Completion**
- [x] Run `./scripts/fix-component-imports.sh`
- [x] Verify output shows successful import fixes
- [x] Run `./scripts/remove-duplicate-components.sh`
- [x] Verify output shows successful duplicate removal
- [x] Run `yarn build` - confirm 0 errors
- [x] Test main functionality in browser

- [x] Plan manual enhancement tasks
- [x] Begin recommendation component consolidation

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### **Rollback Process**
```bash
# If imports script fails, restore from backup
cp -r backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/components/* src/components/
cp -r backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/contexts/* src/contexts/

# If duplicates script fails, restore from backup
cp -r duplicate-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/FoodRecommender src/components/Header/

# Verify build works after rollback
yarn build
```

### **Common Issues**
1. **Build fails after import fixes**
   - Check console output for specific errors
   - Verify utils files exist in new locations
   - Use rollback if needed

2. **Functionality broken after duplicate removal**
   - Check browser console for import errors
