# üìû Escalation Procedures

This guide defines when and how to escalate issues within the WhatToEatNext
project, ensuring appropriate response times and expertise for different types
of problems.

## üéØ Escalation Matrix

### Issue Severity Classification

#### üî¥ P0 - Critical (Immediate Escalation)

**Response Time**: 15 minutes  
**Resolution Time**: 2 hours

**Criteria:**

- Complete system failure or unavailability
- Data corruption or loss
- Security vulnerabilities or breaches
- Complete astrological calculation system failure
- Production deployment blocking issues

**Examples:**

```
‚ùå Build completely broken, cannot deploy
‚ùå All astrological APIs failing with no fallback
‚ùå Data corruption in planetary position files
‚ùå Security vulnerability in API endpoints
‚ùå Campaign system causing data loss
```

#### üü° P1 - High (Same Day Escalation)

**Resolution Time**: 24 hours

**Criteria:**

- Major feature completely non-functional
- Performance severely degraded (>10x slower)
- Incorrect astrological calculations affecting recommendations
- Campaign system failures causing build issues
- Critical TypeScript errors preventing development

**Examples:**

```

## üö® Emergency Response Procedures

### P0 Critical Issue Response

#### Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Assess and contain the issue
npm run emergency:assess          # Quick system assessment
npm run emergency:contain         # Contain the issue if possible

# 2. Notify stakeholders immediately
# - Send alert to #critical-alerts Slack channel
# - Email dev-team@company.com with "P0 CRITICAL" subject
# - Page on-call engineer if after hours

# 3. Create incident record
# - GitHub issue with "P0-Critical" label
# - Include system state, error logs, and impact assessment
# - Document timeline and actions taken
```

#### Response Team Assembly (15-30 minutes)

```
Primary Responder: On-call engineer or issue reporter
Technical Lead: Senior developer familiar with affected system
Subject Matter Expert: Astrological calculations expert (if relevant)
Incident Commander: Project maintainer or designated lead
Communications Lead: For stakeholder updates
```

#### Resolution Process (30 minutes - 2 hours)

```bash
# 1. Implement immediate workaround if possible
npm run emergency:workaround      # Apply temporary fix

# 2. Investigate root cause
npm run debug:comprehensive       # Full system diagnostic
npm run logs:critical            # Gather all relevant logs

# 3. Implement permanent fix
# - Create hotfix branch
# - Implement and test fix
# - Deploy with expedited process

# 4. Post-incident review
# - Document lessons learned
# - Update procedures if needed
# - Implement preventive measures
```

### P1 High Priority Response

#### Initial Response (0-2 hours)

```bash
# 1. Acknowledge and assess
npm run health:check             # System health assessment
npm run debug:targeted           # Focused debugging

# 2. Notify relevant team members
# - Post in #dev-alerts Slack channel
# - Assign GitHub issue to appropriate team member
# - Update project status if needed

# 3. Begin investigation
npm run investigate:issue        # Start detailed investigation
npm run logs:recent             # Gather recent logs and metrics
```

#### Resolution Process (2-24 hours)

```
1. Root Cause Analysis
   - Identify the underlying cause
   - Determine scope of impact
   - Assess risk of similar issues

2. Solution Development
   - Design appropriate fix
   - Consider impact on other systems
   - Plan testing strategy

3. Implementation and Testing
   - Implement fix in development environment
   - Run comprehensive tests
   - Validate fix resolves issue

4. Deployment and Monitoring
   - Deploy to staging for validation
   - Deploy to production with monitoring
   - Monitor for regression or side effects
```

### Escalation Triggers

#### Automatic Escalation Triggers

```typescript
// Automated monitoring that triggers escalation
interface EscalationTrigger {
  condition: string;
  severity: 'P0' | 'P1' | 'P2' | 'P3';
  action: string;
  notification: string[];
}

const ESCALATION_TRIGGERS: EscalationTrigger[] = [
  {
    condition: 'build_failure_duration > 30_minutes',
    severity: 'P0',
    action: 'immediate_escalation',
    notification: ['#critical-alerts', 'dev-team@company.com']
  },
  {
    condition: 'astrological_calculation_errors > 50%',
    severity: 'P1',
    action: 'team_escalation',
    notification: ['#dev-alerts', 'astrology-team@company.com']
  },
  {
    condition: 'typescript_errors > 5000',
    severity: 'P1',
    action: 'campaign_escalation',
    notification: ['#dev-alerts']
  },
  {
    condition: 'performance_degradation > 5x',
    severity: 'P1',
    action: 'performance_escalation',
    notification: ['#performance-alerts']
  }
];
```

#### Manual Escalation Criteria

```
Escalate immediately if:
‚úÖ You've spent 2+ hours without progress
‚úÖ Issue affects multiple team members
‚úÖ Issue blocks critical development work
‚úÖ You lack expertise in the affected area
‚úÖ Issue has security implications
‚úÖ Data integrity is at risk

Consider escalation if:
‚ö†Ô∏è Solution requires architectural changes
‚ö†Ô∏è Issue affects external dependencies
‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple systems are involved
‚ö†Ô∏è Cultural sensitivity concerns arise
‚ö†Ô∏è Performance impact is significant
```

**Remember**: Escalation is not a sign of failure - it's a sign of good
judgment. When in doubt, escalate early rather than late. The goal is to resolve
issues effectively while learning and improving our processes. üöÄ
