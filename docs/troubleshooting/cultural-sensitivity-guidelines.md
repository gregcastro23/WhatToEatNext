## üçΩÔ∏è Culinary Cultural Sensitivity

### Respectful Ingredient Representation

#### Guidelines for Ingredient Names and Descriptions
```typescript
// GOOD: Respectful ingredient representation
interface IngredientCulturalInfo {
  name: string;                    // Use authentic names
  alternativeNames: string[];      // Include regional variations
  culturalOrigin: string[];        // Acknowledge multiple origins
  traditionalUses: string[];       // Describe authentic applications
  culturalSignificance: string;    // Explain cultural importance
  preparationNotes: string;        // Include traditional methods
  respectfulSourcing: boolean;     // Ensure ethical sourcing
}

// Example: Respectful representation
const turmericInfo: IngredientCulturalInfo = {
  name: "Turmeric",
  alternativeNames: ["Haldi", "Curcuma", "Ukon"],
  culturalOrigin: ["South Asian", "Southeast Asian"],
  traditionalUses: [
    "Ayurvedic medicine",
    "Traditional cooking spice",
    "Ceremonial applications"
  ],
  culturalSignificance: "Sacred spice in Hindu traditions, used in ceremonies and daily cooking",
  preparationNotes: "Traditionally ground fresh, often combined with other spices",

  // Don't oversimplify complex traditions
  wrong: "Ancient secret superfood",
  right: "Traditional ingredient with documented historical uses in various cultures",
  
  // Don't use sacred terms inappropriately
  wrong: "Chakra-cleansing smoothie",
  right: "Smoothie inspired by Ayurvedic principles of balance",
  
  // Don't make unsubstantiated spiritual claims
  wrong: "Mystical energy-boosting elixir",
  right: "Traditional preparation known for its energizing properties"
};
```

### Cuisine Representation Guidelines

```typescript
interface CuisineRepresentation {
  name: string;

  subRegions?: string[];
  keyCharacteristics: string[];

  culturalContext: "Deeply connected to Ayurvedic principles, religious practices, and regional agricultural traditions",
  expertConsultation: true,
  communityFeedback: true
};
```

#### Avoiding Cuisine Stereotypes
```typescript
// Guidelines for avoiding stereotypes
const cuisineStereotypesToAvoid = {
  oversimplification: {
    wrong: "All Asian food is spicy",
    right: "Asian cuisines encompass diverse flavor profiles, from mild to intensely spiced"
  },
  
  generalization: {
