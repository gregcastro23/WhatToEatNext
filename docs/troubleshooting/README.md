## 🚨 Quick Reference

### Emergency Procedures

```bash
# System completely broken
bun run emergency:reset           # Reset to last known good state
git stash && bun run build       # Quick recovery test

# Astrological calculations failing
bun run debug:astronomy          # Run astronomical diagnostics
bun run fallback:enable          # Enable fallback mode

# Performance severely degraded
bun run performance:profile      # Generate performance report
bun run cache:clear              # Clear all caches
```

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# System health check
bun run health:check             # Comprehensive system check
bun run health:astrological      # Astrological system check
bun run health:performance       # Performance metrics check

# Debug information
bun run debug:info               # System debug information
bun run debug:kiro               # Kiro integration status
bun run debug:campaigns          # Campaign system status
```
