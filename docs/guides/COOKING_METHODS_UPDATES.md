# Cooking Methods Data Integration

This document summarizes the updates made to better integrate the comprehensive
cooking methods data across the application.

## Files Updated

### 1. `/src/data/cooking/cookingMethods.ts`

- Added more cooking methods (from 3 to 8)
- Enhanced existing methods with more detailed information
- Added helper functions:
  - `getDetailedCookingMethod(methodName)`: Retrieves detailed data for a
    specific method
  - `getCookingMethodNames()`: Gets list of all method names
  - `getCookingMethodsByElement(element, threshold)`: Finds methods compatible
    with an element

### 2. `/src/utils/cookingMethodTips.ts`

- Added `getDetailedCookingMethod` integration for getting technical tips
- Enhanced `getIdealIngredients` to use detailed cooking method data
- Added layered fallback approach for data retrieval

### 3. `/src/utils/cookingMethodRecommender.ts`

- Added imports for helper functions
- Enhanced `getMethodThermodynamics` to use detailed cooking methods
- Improved lookup logic with proper fallbacks

### 4. `/src/data/cooking/index.ts`

- Enhanced `getCookingMethod` function to use the detailed lookup
- Maintained backward compatibility

### 5. `/src/components/CookingMethodsSection.tsx`

- Enhanced display of detailed method information
- Added historical background, scientific principles, food pairings, and more to
  the UI

2. **Element-Based Selection**: New helper function allows finding cooking
   methods by elemental alignment

3. **Improved Recommendations**: Technical recommendations now leverage detailed
   method data

4. **Enhanced UI**: More comprehensive method details in the interface

## Benefits
