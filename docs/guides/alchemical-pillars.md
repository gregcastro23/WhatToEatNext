# Alchemical Pillars System Guide

## Overview

Our application maps traditional cooking methods to 14 alchemical transformation processes (Calcination, Fermentation, Distillation, etc.), providing nuanced cooking recommendations that honor ancient wisdom.

Each pillar affects the four alchemical properties (Spirit, Essence, Matter, and Substance) differently, creating a sophisticated framework for understanding culinary transformations.

## The 14 Alchemical Pillars

1. **Calcination** - High-heat cooking methods that transform ingredients through intense heat
2. **Dissolution** - Methods that break down ingredients through liquid mediums
3. **Separation** - Techniques that divide ingredients into their constituent parts
4. **Conjunction** - Methods that combine ingredients to create new compounds
5. **Fermentation** - Processes that transform ingredients through microbial action
6. **Distillation** - Techniques that extract and purify essences
7. **Coagulation** - Methods that solidify or thicken ingredients
8. **Cibation** - Processes that nourish and enhance ingredients
9. **Sublimation** - Techniques that transform ingredients through vaporization
10. **Fixation** - Methods that stabilize and preserve ingredients
11. **Multiplication** - Processes that amplify flavors and properties
12. **Projection** - Techniques that apply final transformative touches
13. **Exaltation** - Methods that elevate ingredients to their highest potential
14. **Transmutation** - Processes that fundamentally transform ingredients

## Implementation

Each cooking method in our system is mapped to one or more alchemical pillars, creating a rich framework for understanding and recommending cooking techniques. This mapping considers:

- The elemental properties of ingredients
- The desired outcome of the cooking process
- The astrological influences at play
- The seasonal context of the preparation

## Usage in Recommendations

The Alchemical Pillars system is used to:

1. Match cooking methods to ingredient properties
2. Suggest complementary techniques
3. Create harmonious cooking sequences
4. Optimize flavor development
5. Enhance nutritional value
