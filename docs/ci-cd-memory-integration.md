# CI/CD Memory Management Integration Guide

## Overview

The WhatToEatNext project now includes comprehensive memory management
integration for CI/CD pipelines, ensuring reliable test execution and preventing
memory-related failures in automated environments.

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline Integration

### Memory-Optimized Jobs

All CI jobs are now configured with optimized memory settings:

```yaml
env:
  NODE_OPTIONS: "--expose-gc --max-old-space-size=2048 --optimize-for-size"
```

### Pipeline Structure

1. **Lint Job**: Memory-optimized linting with 2GB limit
2. **Build Job**: Memory-safe build process with optimization
3. **Test Job**: Comprehensive memory-safe testing with monitoring
4. **Memory Monitoring Job**: Post-pipeline memory analysis and reporting

## üß™ Memory-Safe Testing Commands

### Available Commands in CI

```bash
# Pre-test optimization
yarn test:optimize-memory

# Memory-safe test execution
yarn test:memory-safe --passWithNoTests --verbose --coverage

# Memory status reporting
yarn test:memory-report

# Emergency cleanup
yarn test:emergency-cleanup
```

### Test Job Memory Flow

```yaml
# 1. Pre-test Memory Optimization
- name: Pre-test Memory Optimization
  run: |
    echo "üöÄ Running pre-test memory optimization..."
    yarn test:optimize-memory
    echo "üìä Initial memory status:"
    yarn test:memory-report

# 2. Memory-Safe Test Execution
- name: Run Memory-Safe Tests
  run: |
    echo "üß™ Running tests with memory management..."
    yarn test:memory-safe --passWithNoTests --verbose --coverage

# 3. Post-test Analysis and Cleanup
- name: Post-test Memory Analysis
  if: always()
  run: |
    echo "üìä Post-test memory analysis:"
    yarn test:memory-report
    echo "üßπ Running cleanup..."
    yarn test:emergency-cleanup
```

## üìä Memory Monitoring and Reporting

### Automated Memory Reports

The CI pipeline generates comprehensive memory reports:

- **Memory Optimization Results**: Pre-test optimization outcomes
- **Test Execution Memory Usage**: Real-time memory tracking during tests
- **Post-test Analysis**: Memory usage summary and cleanup results
- **System Memory Information**: Available system resources
- **Memory Recommendations**: Actionable insights for optimization

### Artifact Collection

Memory reports are automatically collected and stored:

```yaml
- name: Upload Memory Reports
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: memory-reports
    path: |
      logs/memory-reports/
      logs/memory-alerts.log
    retention-days: 7
```

### Comprehensive Memory Analysis Job

A dedicated memory monitoring job runs after all other jobs:

- Analyzes overall pipeline memory performance
- Generates comprehensive memory analysis report
- Provides system-level memory recommendations
- Archives detailed memory metrics for 30 days

## üîß Configuration Details

### Memory Limits and Thresholds

```javascript
// Jest Configuration (jest.config.js)
{
  maxWorkers: process.env.CI ? 1 : 2,
  workerIdleMemoryLimit: '512MB',
  logHeapUsage: true,
  detectOpenHandles: true,
  forceExit: true
}

// Memory Thresholds (setupMemoryManagement.ts)
const MEMORY_CONFIG = {
  warningThreshold: 100,      // 100MB warning
  errorThreshold: 500,        // 500MB error
  emergencyCleanupThreshold: 500, // 500MB emergency cleanup
  forceCleanupThreshold: 100  // 100MB force cleanup
};
```

### Node.js Optimization Flags

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--expose-gc --max-old-space-size=2048 --optimize-for-size"
```

- `--expose-gc`: Enables manual garbage collection
- `--max-old-space-size=2048`: Sets 2GB memory limit
- `--optimize-for-size`: Optimizes for memory usage over speed

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Memory Failure Recovery

If tests fail due to memory issues:

1. **Automatic Recovery**: Emergency cleanup is triggered automatically
2. **Manual Recovery**: Use `yarn test:emergency-cleanup`
3. **Analysis**: Check memory reports in CI artifacts
4. **Adjustment**: Modify memory thresholds if needed

### Monitoring Alerts

The system monitors for:

- Memory usage exceeding warning thresholds
- Memory leaks during test execution
- System memory exhaustion
- Test failures due to memory issues

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Expected Improvements

- **Memory Usage**: 40-60% reduction in peak memory usage
- **Test Stability**: Elimination of out-of-memory crashes
- **CI Reliability**: Consistent execution in resource-constrained environments
- **Build Speed**: Optimized memory usage improves overall performance

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Memory Freed per Test**: 1-28MB average cleanup
- **Peak Memory Usage**: 58-67MB typical range
- **Memory Leak Detection**: 7 different leak patterns monitored
- **Emergency Cleanups**: Tracked and reported

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development Integration

### Running CI-equivalent Tests Locally

```bash
# Simulate CI memory constraints
NODE_OPTIONS="--expose-gc --max-old-space-size=2048 --optimize-for-size" yarn test:memory-safe

# Full CI simulation
yarn test:optimize-memory && yarn test:memory-safe --coverage && yarn test:emergency-cleanup
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Pre-commit**: Run memory optimization
2. **Development**: Use memory-safe test commands
3. **Pre-push**: Verify memory performance
4. **CI Integration**: Automatic memory management in pipeline

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### High Memory Usage

```bash
# Check current memory status
yarn test:memory-report

# Run optimization
yarn test:optimize-memory

# Emergency cleanup
yarn test:emergency-cleanup
```

#### Test Failures

```bash
# Run with strict memory limits
yarn test:memory-safe --maxWorkers=1

# Check for memory leaks
yarn test:memory-safe --detectOpenHandles --forceExit
```

#### CI Memory Issues

1. Check memory reports in CI artifacts
2. Review comprehensive memory analysis
3. Adjust memory thresholds if needed
4. Consider reducing test parallelism
