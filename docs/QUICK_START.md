# 🚀 WhatToEatNext Quick Start Guide

Welcome to WhatToEatNext - the world's first comprehensive astrological meal
planning system that bridges ancient wisdom with modern AI technology.

## 🎯 What You Need to Know in 5 Minutes

### What is WhatToEatNext?

WhatToEatNext provides personalized food recommendations based on:

- **Current planetary positions** and lunar phases
- **Individual astrological profiles** and elemental constitutions
- **Seasonal astronomical cycles** and cosmic timing
- **Cultural culinary traditions** with astrological foundations
- **Modern nutritional science** integrated with ancient wisdom

### Core Principles

- **Four-Element System**: Fire, Water, Earth, Air harmony in every meal
- **Self-Reinforcement**: Elements work best with themselves (Fire + Fire = 0.9+
  compatibility)
- **No Opposition**: All element combinations have good compatibility (≥0.7)
- **Cultural Respect**: Honoring diverse traditions while providing cosmic
  guidance
