## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Build is Broken" 🚨
**Immediate Actions:**
1. Run [Health Check](../scripts/recovery/health-check.sh): `./scripts/recovery/health-check.sh`
2. If TypeScript errors > 50: Run [Emergency TS Fix](../scripts/recovery/emergency-ts-fix.sh)
3. If still broken: Follow [Recovery Procedure](./linting-excellence-recovery-procedure.md)

**Documentation Path:**
```
Health Check → Emergency Fix → Full Recovery Procedure → Validation
```

### Scenario 2: "Specific Error Pattern" 🔍
**Research Actions:**
1. Check [Troubleshooting Guide](./linting-troubleshooting-guide.md) for the specific error
2. Look up the error in [Knowledge Base](./linting-excellence-knowledge-base.md#error-pattern-encyclopedia)
3. Use appropriate script from [Recovery Scripts](../scripts/recovery/README.md)

**Documentation Path:**
```
Troubleshooting Guide → Knowledge Base → Script Repository → Validation
```

### Scenario 3: "Performance Issues" ⚡
**Optimization Actions:**
1. Check [Performance Benchmarks](./linting-excellence-knowledge-base.md#performance-optimization)
2. Review [Build Performance](./linting-troubleshooting-guide.md#build-performance-issues)
3. Apply optimization scripts from [Recovery Repository](../scripts/recovery/README.md)

**Documentation Path:**
```
Knowledge Base (Performance) → Troubleshooting Guide → Optimization Scripts
```

### Scenario 4: "Prevention Setup" 🛡️
**Setup Actions:**
1. Review [Prevention Measures](./prevention-measures.md)
2. Set up [CI/CD Quality Gates](../.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml)
3. Configure [Monitoring Systems](../scripts/monitoring/)

**Documentation Path:**
```
Prevention Measures → CI/CD Setup → Monitoring Configuration
```

### Scenario 5: "New Team Member Onboarding" 👋
**Learning Path:**
1. Start with [Knowledge Base Overview](./linting-excellence-knowledge-base.md#overview)
2. Understand [Historical Context](./linting-excellence-knowledge-base.md#historical-context)
3. Practice with [Health Check](../scripts/recovery/health-check.sh)
4. Review [Common Patterns](./linting-troubleshooting-guide.md#quick-reference)

**Documentation Path:**
```
Knowledge Base → Historical Context → Hands-on Practice → Pattern Recognition
```

## Quick Reference Commands

### Health Assessment
```bash
# Quick health check
./scripts/recovery/health-check.sh

# Detailed validation
node scripts/recovery/validate-recovery-success.cjs --report

# Performance analysis
time yarn tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck
time yarn lint:quick
time yarn build
```

### Emergency Recovery
```bash
# Emergency TypeScript fix
./scripts/recovery/emergency-ts-fix.sh

# Full recovery procedure
./scripts/recovery/full-recovery.sh

# Rollback if needed
git stash pop
```

### Monitoring
```bash
# Error count tracking
yarn tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck 2>&1 | grep -c "error TS"

# ESLint analysis
yarn lint:quick --format=json | node -e "/* count errors */"

# Build performance
time yarn build
```
