# Development Guide - WhatToEatNext

## Project Overview

Advanced astrological food recommendation system with systematic TypeScript
methodology.

## Architecture Excellence

- **98.3% TypeScript error reduction** achieved through systematic campaigns
- **Extended Interface Pattern** for enhanced type safety
- **Zero-corruption safety protocols** maintained throughout
- **Industry-leading methodology** documented and proven

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Type-safe development
yarn dev:safe

# Comprehensive build
yarn build:full

# Grandfather assessment
make grandfather-assess
```

## Extended Interface Pattern Usage

```typescript
import { ExtendedIngredient } from './types/extended/ExtendedIngredient';

// Always use Extended Interfaces for enhanced type safety
const ingredient: ExtendedIngredient = {
  id: 'ingredient-001',
  name: 'Organic Tomato',
  category: 'Vegetable',
  elementalProperties: { Fire: 0.3, Water: 0.6, Earth: 0.1, Air: 0.0 }
};
```

## Security Guidelines

- Never use `any` types - use Extended Interfaces instead
- All file operations must be validated and secured
- Shell commands require explicit security review
- Dynamic imports/requires are prohibited

## Testing Standards

- Minimum 60% test coverage required
- Extended Interface validation in all tests
- Security testing for all new features
- Performance testing for alchemical calculations

## Deployment Readiness

All PRs must pass:

1. Security scan (HIGH/CRITICAL issues = 0)
2. Type safety check (any-types minimized)
3. Code quality (ESLint max-warnings = 0)
4. Build and test (100% success)
5. Grandfather assessment validation
