# Dependency Resolution Cleanup Summary

## Task 7: Dependency Resolution Cleanup - COMPLETED ✅

### Issues Resolved

#### 1. Broken Import Paths Fixed

- ✅ Fixed import paths in `src/utils/astrology/astrologicalRules.test.ts`
- ✅ Created missing `LazyComponent.tsx` files for test directories
- ✅ Verified `CustomComponent` and `useCustomHook` exist and are properly
  exported
- ✅ Fixed duplicate imports in `src/data/ingredients/index.ts`

#### 2. Circular Dependencies Eliminated

- ✅ Audited barrel exports in `src/types/index.ts`, `src/contexts/index.ts`,
  and `src/calculations/index.ts`
- ✅ Fixed problematic import patterns in ingredients data files
- ✅ Removed circular references between protein modules
- ✅ No circular dependencies detected in final validation

#### 3. Barrel Export Issues Resolved

- ✅ Validated all exports in main index files
- ✅ Fixed undefined exports in ingredients collection
- ✅ Ensured all re-exported modules exist and are accessible
- ✅ Cleaned up duplicate and conflicting exports

#### 4. Dependency Validation System Added

- ✅ Created comprehensive `src/utils/dependencyValidation.ts` utility
- ✅ Added automated dependency validation script
  `scripts/validate-dependencies.ts`
- ✅ Integrated validation into package.json scripts (`deps:validate`,
  `deps:fix`)
- ✅ Added pre-commit hook to prevent future dependency issues

### Validation Results

**Before Cleanup:**

- Multiple "Cannot find module" errors
- Broken import paths in test files
- Circular dependency risks in barrel exports
- Undefined exports causing runtime errors

**After Cleanup:**

- ✅ 0 "Cannot find module" errors
- ✅ All import paths validated and working
- ✅ No circular dependencies detected
- ✅ All barrel exports properly defined

### Prevention Measures Implemented

#### 1. Automated Validation

```bash
# Validate all dependencies
yarn deps:validate

# Auto-fix common issues
yarn deps:fix
```

#### 2. Pre-commit Hooks

- Dependency validation runs before each commit
- Prevents broken imports from being committed
- Validates import patterns against problematic patterns

#### 3. Validation Utilities

- `validateImportPath()` - Checks if import paths exist
- `detectCircularDependencies()` - Finds circular dependency chains
- `validateBarrelExports()` - Ensures all exports are defined
- `autoFixDependencyIssues()` - Automatically fixes common problems

#### 4. Problematic Pattern Detection

- Detects imports from index files in same directory
- Identifies deep relative imports that risk circular dependencies
- Warns about re-exports that could create cycles

### Files Modified

#### Core Fixes

- `src/utils/astrology/astrologicalRules.test.ts` - Fixed import paths
- `src/data/ingredients/index.ts` - Fixed duplicate imports
- `package.json` - Added dependency validation scripts

#### New Files Created

- `src/utils/dependencyValidation.ts` - Comprehensive validation utilities
- `scripts/validate-dependencies.ts` - Automated validation script
- `.husky/pre-commit` - Pre-commit validation hook
- `DEPENDENCY_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Requirements Satisfied

✅ **8.1** - Audit and fix all broken import paths in the project ✅ **8.2** -
Remove circular dependencies between modules ✅ **8.3** - Fix barrel export
issues that create undefined exports ✅ **8.4** - Add dependency validation to
prevent future import issues ✅ **8.5** - Ensure all imports are properly
resolved and accessible

### Future Maintenance

The implemented validation system will:

1. **Prevent** new dependency issues through pre-commit hooks
2. **Detect** problems early with automated validation
3. **Fix** common issues automatically with the auto-fix feature
4. **Report** on dependency health with comprehensive reporting

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Daily validation
yarn deps:validate

# Fix issues automatically
yarn deps:fix

# Check specific patterns
yarn lint:import-resolution-test

# Clear caches if needed
yarn lint:cache-clear
```

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

All dependency resolution issues have been resolved and prevention measures are
in place to maintain clean dependencies going forward.
