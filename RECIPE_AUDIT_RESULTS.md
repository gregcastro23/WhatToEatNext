# Recipe Data Audit Results

**Date**: February 2, 2026
**Total Recipes Audited**: 480
**Completion Rate**: 0% (see notes below)

## Executive Summary

All 480 recipes have complete core data (ingredients, instructions, basic nutrition) but are flagged as incomplete due to two missing fields: `fiber` and `prepTime`.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Fiber Data (Priority: High)
All recipes have nutrition objects containing calories, protein, carbs, and fat, but fiber is not included. This impacts the Menu Planner's ability to track complete macros.

**Recommendation**: Add fiber values to all recipe nutrition objects, either:
- Manually research and add fiber content
- Estimate based on ingredient types (vegetables, grains, legumes typically high in fiber)

### 2. Missing prepTime Field (Priority: Medium)
The audit checks for a `prepTime` field, but recipes use `timeToMake` instead. This is a schema mismatch rather than missing data.

**Recommendation**: Either:
- Update the audit to check `timeToMake` instead of `prepTime`
- Add `prepTime` and `cookTime` fields to recipes for more granular timing

### 3. African Cuisine Data Structure (Priority: High)
The African cuisine file has a malformed data structure where `dishes.breakfast` is undefined, causing an error during recipe extraction.

**Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'breakfast')`

**Recommendation**: Audit and fix the African cuisine data file to match the standard structure used by other cuisines.

## Data Quality Assessment

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Core Ingredients | 100% | All recipes have ingredient lists with names |
| Ingredient Details | ~95% | Most have amount/unit, some missing |
| Instructions | 100% | All recipes have preparation steps |
| Basic Nutrition | 100% | Calories, protein, carbs, fat present |
| Complete Nutrition | 0% | Fiber missing from all |
| Timing Data | 100% | All have timeToMake (not prepTime) |
| Descriptions | 100% | All recipes have descriptions |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix African cuisine data structure
2. **Short-term**: Add fiber data to high-use cuisines (American, Italian, Mexican)
3. **Medium-term**: Complete fiber data for all cuisines
4. **Optional**: Refactor to add prepTime/cookTime fields
