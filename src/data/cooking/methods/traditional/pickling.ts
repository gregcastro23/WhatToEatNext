  // Additional metadata
  history: 'Pickling has been practiced for at least 4,000 years, originating as a necessity for food preservation before refrigeration. Ancient Mesopotamians pickled foods in brineas documented in cuneiform tablets from 2400 BCE. The word \'pickle\' derives from the Dutch \'pekel\' or German \'pökel,\' referring to salt or brine. In ancient times, pickling was essential for long sea voyages and military campaigns. Cleopatra attributed her beauty to a diet of pickles. Throughout history, sailors consumed pickled foods to prevent scurvy. During the 17th and 18th centuries, pickled vegetables were vital for long ocean voyages. The Industrial Revolution standardized pickling processes, with companies like Heinz mass-producing pickled products by the late 19th century. In the 20th century, refrigeration reduced dependency on pickling for preservation, but cultural traditions and flavors have kept the method relevant worldwide.',

  scientificPrinciples: [
    'Acid preservation lowers pH, inhibiting microbial growth',
    'Salt in fermented pickles creates selective environment for beneficial bacteria',
    'Osmotic pressure draws water from vegetables, aiding preservation',
    'Lactic acid bacteria convert sugars to acids in fermented pickles',
    'Acetic acid from vinegar penetrates cell membranes for preservation',
    'Antioxidants in spices help preserve color and nutrients',
    'Heat processing in canning destroys enzymes that cause spoilage',
    'Vacuum sealing prevents oxidation and contamination',
    'Competing beneficial bacteria exclude pathogens in fermented pickles',
    'Salt concentration affects osmosis rate and texture development',
    'Acid concentration determines preservation effectiveness and flavor intensity',
    'Spice volatile compounds infuse through acidic medium',
    'Sugar balances acidity and contributes to flavor development',
    'Temperature affects fermentation rate and microbial selection',
    'Vegetable cell structure determines pickling liquid absorption rate'
