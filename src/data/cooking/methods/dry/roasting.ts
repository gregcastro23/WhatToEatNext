  history: 'Roasting is one of humanity\'s oldest cooking methods, dating back to the discovery of fire approximately 1.8 million years ago. Archaeological evidence shows spit roasting was common in ancient civilizations throughout Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China. Medieval Europe developed sophisticated roasting techniques, including specialized turnspits operated by servants or even dogs. The 18th century saw innovations like the tin reflector oven, while the 19th century brought reliable temperature-controlled roasting in cast iron stoves. The development of gas and electric ovens in the 20th century standardized roasting temperatures, while the late 20th and early 21st centuries have seen a renewed interest in traditional methods including wood-fired ovens, rotisserie cooking, and precision temperature control with digital technology.',

  ],
  
  ingredientPreparation: {
    'beef': 'Remove from refrigerator 1-2 hours before cooking; dry thoroughly with paper towels; season liberally with salt (1 tsp per pound) 24 hours before cooking. For prime rib, request bone-in, tied but bone cut away from meat for carving ease. Apply coarse black pepper just before roasting. For tenderloin, consider tying at intervals to maintain even shape.',
    'poultry': 'Spatchcock for even cooking; dry brine with salt 12-24 hours in advance; air-dry uncovered in refrigerator overnight for crisp skin. For whole birds, loosen skin and apply butter or herb paste between skin and meat. For turkey, consider removing legs and cooking separately from breast. Truss or clip wings behind back to prevent burning.',
    'vegetables': 'Cut to uniform size (approximately 1-inch pieces); toss with oil and seasonings; arrange in single layer with space between pieces. For dense root vegetables, consider par-boiling for 5-10 minutes before roasting. For high-sugar vegetables like carrots, add a pinch of baking soda to water for faster caramelization. Group vegetables by cooking time on separate trays.',
    'nuts': 'Toss raw nuts with small amount of oil and salt; spread in single layer; shake pan every 5 minutes during roasting. Consider soaking in salted water for 30 minutes and drying before roasting for enhanced flavor penetration. For sweet applications, coat lightly with egg white whisked with water before adding sugar or spices.',
    'pork': 'For crackling, score skin in diamond pattern; rub with salt and allow to dry uncovered in refrigerator overnight; pat completely dry before roasting. For tenderloin, remove silverskin completely. For shoulder/butt cuts, consider overnight brining. For ribs, remove membrane from bone side. For chops, brine for 4 hours, dry thoroughly.',
    'lamb': 'Make incisions and insert garlic slivers and herb sprigs; season with salt and allow to rest uncovered for 2-4 hours before cooking. For leg, tunnel bone for even cooking or butterfly for faster roasting. For rack, french the bones and create uniform thickness. For shoulder, consider slow roasting at 275°F for 4-5 hours.',
    'fish': 'Score skin to prevent curling; stuff cavity with aromatics; brush with oil; use parchment or foil sling for easy removal. For whole fish, ensure scales and gills are removed. For fillets, place skin-side down on preheated pan. For delicate white fish, create herb crust for protection. For oily fish, reduce oven temperature by at least 25°F.',
    'fruits': 'Remove pits or cores; cut into uniform pieces; toss with small amount of sugar and spices to enhance caramelization. For apples and pears, treat with lemon water to prevent browning. For stone fruits, roast cut-side up initially, then flip for final caramelization. For citrus, leave peel on for aromatic oils. For bananas, leave in peel and slit one side.'

  timingConsiderations: {
    'rest_before': 'Bring refrigerated meats to room temperature for 30-60 minutes; season 1-48 hours in advance depending on size. Whole poultry: 1 hour per 4 pounds. Roasts: 1 hour per 5 pounds. Vegetables and fruits require no rest period before roasting.',
    'rest_after': 'Rest beef and lamb 10-20 minutes; poultry 15-30 minutes; pork 10-15 minutes to allow juice redistribution. For large prime rib (5+ pounds), rest up to 30-45 minutes in warm area. For tenderloins, 8-10 minutes is sufficient. Tent with foil but don\'t seal completely to prevent steam softening the crust.',
    'carryover_cooking': 'Internal temperature will rise 5-10°F for small cuts, 10-15°F for large roasts during resting period. Poultry breasts: 5-10°F rise. Beef rib roast: 10-15°F rise. Pork loin: 5-10°F rise. Fish: minimal rise of 2-5°F. Account for this by removing from heat when temperature reads 5-15°F below target.',
    'temperature_adjustment': 'Reduce oven temperature by 25°F when using convection; increase by 25°F when cooking multiple items. Glass or dark metal pans: reduce by 25°F. High altitude (3,000+ feet): increase by 25°F and extend time by 5-10%.',
    'timing_by_weight': 'Calculate roasting time by weight: beef (rare) 15 min/lb, poultry 20 min/lb, pork 20 min/lb at standard temperatures. Precise timing varies by thickness rather than weight: 2-inch thick cuts require different timing than thin, flat cuts of same weight.',
    'seasonal_adjustment': 'Reduce cooking time for summer vegetables by 15%; increase for winter vegetables by 10%. Adjust for humidity: drier environments may require lower temperatures or shorter times. Higher ambient humidity may require extended cooking times.'

    'beef_well': 'Internal temperature 150°F; firm when pressed; brown throughout. Finger test: feels like base of thumb when thumb and pinky make an "OK" sign. No pink visible and meat fibers are clearly defined.',
    'poultry': 'Internal temperature 165°F in thigh; juices run clear; leg moves easily in socket. Probe inserted between thigh and body should meet minimal resistance. For breast, 155°F with rest will achieve safety while maintaining juiciness.',
    'pork': 'Internal temperature 145°F with 3-minute rest; slightly pink center is safe and optimal. Modern pork is safe at lower temperatures than historically recommended. Texture should be firm but yield to gentle pressure.',
    'lamb_medium_rare': 'Internal temperature 130-135°F; springy when pressed; pink center. Color should be rosy with clear juice. For shoulder cuts, 175°F for proper collagen breakdown.',

  ingredientInteractions: {
    'fats_and_aromatics': 'Fat absorbs and distributes flavor compounds from herbs and spices; baste regularly to enhance distribution. Fat-soluble flavor compounds in herbs (thyme, rosemary) infuse more effectively than water-soluble compounds. Choose fats based on smoke point: butter (350°F), olive oil (375-405°F), avocado oil (520°F).',
    'acid_and_protein': 'Acidic marinades (lemon, vinegar, wine) tenderize surface proteins but can tough them if applied too long. Limit acidic marinades to 2 hours for fish, 4 hours for poultry, 12 hours maximum for beef. Post-cooking acid application brightens flavors.',
    'sugars_and_heat': 'Sugary glazes should be applied in final 15-30 minutes to prevent burning. Honey and maple glazes caramelize faster than granulated sugar. Addition of small amount of acid to sweet glazes prevents crystallization. Natural fruit sugars caramelize effectively at 350-375°F.',
    'salt_timing': 'Early salting (12+ hours) for penetration and moisture retention; last-minute salting for crust only. Kosher salt provides better adhesion than table salt. Salt draws out moisture initially, which is reabsorbed with dissolved proteins for enhanced juiciness.',
    'alcohol_evaporation': 'Wine or spirit additions need sufficient time (45+ minutes) for alcohol to fully evaporate. Alcohol content retention: 15 minutes cooking (40% remains), 30 minutes (35%), 1 hour (25%), 2 hours (10%). Deglaze with alcohol after browning to incorporate fond (browned bits).',
    'enzyme_reactions': 'Bromelain in pineapple or papain in papaya break down proteins and can create mushy texture if overused. Limit enzyme marinades to 30 minutes for seafood, 2 hours for poultry, 4 hours for beef. Heat above 158°F deactivates most enzymes.',
    'vegetable_density': 'Root vegetables require pre-roasting before adding less dense vegetables to ensure even cooking. Stagger addition: dense roots first, cruciferous second, tender vegetables last. Alternatively, cut denser vegetables smaller than less dense ones.',
    'starchy_vegetable_browning': 'Parboil starchy vegetables for 5-10 minutes before roasting for enhanced exterior crispness. Adding 1/2 teaspoon baking soda to parboiling water accelerates surface starch breakdown for improved browning. Thoroughly dry parboiled vegetables before oiling and roasting.',
    'protein_structure': 'Different muscle fibers respond uniquely to heat: fast-twitch muscles (breast meat) cook quickly and easily dry out; slow-twitch muscles (legs, shoulders) require slower cooking for collagen conversion.',
    'fat_cap_positioning': 'Place fat cap up for self-basting effect on lean cuts; place cap down on fatty cuts to render into pan for later use. Shield lean areas with bacon or fatback to prevent drying during extended roasting.',
    'aromatic_intensity': 'Dried herbs should be applied before cooking; fresh herbs partition into early additions (woody types) and finishing herbs (tender varieties). Garlic bitter compounds develop after prolonged high-heat exposure; add halfway through for optimal flavor.'
