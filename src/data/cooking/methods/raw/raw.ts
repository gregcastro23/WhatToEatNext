  history: 'The practice of eating foods in their natural, uncooked state dates back to the beginning of human existence, predating cooking technologies. Throughout history, various cultures developed sophisticated raw food preparations, from Mediterranean crudo to Polynesian poisson cru and Japanese sashimi. The modern raw food movement emerged in the 1800s with figures like Sylvester Graham advocating for unprocessed foods. Dr. Max Bircher-Benner's raw food sanitarium in the early 1900s popularized therapeutic raw eating (creating muesli in the process). The 1970s saw increased interest in \"living foods\" through Ann Wigmore's work. By the 1990s-2000s, raw food cuisine evolved into a sophisticated culinary approach with chefs like Matthew Kenney elevating raw preparation to fine dining. Today's approach integrates traditional knowledge with modern nutritional science and creative culinary techniques.',

  scientificPrinciples: [
    'Enzyme preservation occurs below ~118°F (48°C) - the threshold at which most food enzymes denature',
    'Mechanical cell disruption through cutting/blending releases nutrients and flavors without heat',
    'Water-soluble vitamins (BC) remain intact without thermal degradation',
    'Phytochemical structures maintain biological activity without heat alteration',
    'Natural antioxidants remain at maximum potency without oxidative thermal stress',
    'Fermentation creates probiotic cultures and transforms nutrients without heat application',
    'Acid-based preparations (like ceviche) denature proteins through pH change rather than heat',
    'Salt and sugar drawing moisture through osmosis creates texture changes without cooking',
    'Sprouting activates natural enzymatic processes that transform nutrients',
    'Plant defensive compounds (some beneficial, some anti-nutritional) remain intact without cooking',
    'Oil-soluble compounds remain in original cell structures unless mechanically extracted',
    'Oxidative reactions occur at slower rates without heat acceleration',
    'Dehydration below critical temperatures preserves enzyme activity while removing water',
    'Cold-pressing techniques extract oils without damaging heat-sensitive compounds',
    'Natural ripening processes involve enzymatic transformation of carbohydrates and softening of tissues'
