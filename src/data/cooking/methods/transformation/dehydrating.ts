  name: 'Dehydrating',
  description: 'A preservation method that removes moisture from food through controlled evaporation, concentrating flavors and nutrients while extending shelf life.',
  history: 'Dehydration is one of humanity\'s oldest food preservation techniques, dating back to prehistoric times. Sun-drying fruits, vegetables, and meats was practiced across ancient civilizations including Egypt, China, and the Middle East.',
  science: 'Dehydration works by removing water that microorganisms need to survive. By reducing the water activity to below 0.6, bacterial growth is inhibited. The process also concentrates flavors and nutrients while reducing weight and volume.',
