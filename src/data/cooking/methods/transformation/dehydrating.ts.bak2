  suitable_for: ['Fruits', 'Vegetables', 'Herbs', 'Meats', 'Mushrooms', 'Flowers', 'Seeds'],
  benefits: [
    'Preserves most nutrients',
    'Creates lightweight, portable food',
    'No additives or preservatives needed',
    'Concentrates antioxidants and nutrients',
    'Reduces food waste'
  ],
  history:
    'Dehydration is one of humanity\'s oldest food preservation techniques, dating back to prehistoric times. Sun-drying fruits, vegetables, and meats was practiced across ancient civilizations including Egypt, China, and the Middle East.',
  modernVariations: [
    'Sun drying (traditional method using solar heat)',
    'Air drying (hanging in a cool, dry place)',
    'Oven drying (using low heat in a conventional oven)',
    'Food dehydrator (using specialized equipment)',
    'Freeze-drying (removing water through sublimation)'
  ],
