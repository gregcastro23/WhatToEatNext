  description: 'A technique that transfers flavors, colors, aromas, or medicinal properties from herbs, spices, fruits, or other ingredients into a liquid base such as oil, water, alcohol, or vinegar.',
  history: 'Infusion has ancient roots in culinary and medicinal traditions around the world. It was widely used in traditional medicine for creating herbal remedies and in cuisine for imparting subtle flavors to foods and beverages.',
  science: 'Infusion works through the principle of diffusion, where compounds from the flavoring ingredients dissolve into the base liquid. Heat often accelerates this process by increasing the solubility of flavor compounds and breaking down cell walls.',
