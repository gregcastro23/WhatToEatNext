  description:
    'A cooking and preservation method that exposes food to smoke from burning wood, herbs, or other materials, imparting flavor and helping preserve the food.',
  history:
    'Smoking has been used for thousands of years across many cultures as a way to preserve and flavor food, particularly meats and fish. It was an essential preservation technique before refrigeration.',
  science:
    'Smoking preserves food through a combination of dehydration, low heat cooking, and the deposition of antimicrobial compounds found in the smoke. These compounds include phenols and aldehydes that inhibit bacterial growth while adding flavor.',
