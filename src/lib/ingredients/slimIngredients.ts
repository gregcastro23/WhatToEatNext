/**
 * Slim projection of the ingredient catalog for the `/ingredients` page.
 *
 * The full `allIngredients` collection is ~2.6 MB of serialized data (1021
 * ingredients × heavy alchemical / astrological / nutritional / lunar fields).
 * The discovery page only reads a small slice of that — list search/filter,
 * the Amazon Fresh mapping, and `getCulinaryDetails()` for expanded cards.
 *
 * Importing the full catalog into the `"use client"` page shipped the entire
 * 2.6 MB to the browser (and baked it into the static prerender). This module
 * is `server-only`, so it stays out of the client bundle; the server component
 * passes the slim array (~1.1 MB, ~43% of full) to the client island as props
 * instead. Everything dropped here (lunarPhaseModifiers, nutritional / sensory
 * / astrological profiles, storage, etc.) is unused by the page.
 *
 * Keep this field list in sync with the reads in
 * `src/app/ingredients/IngredientsExplorer.tsx` — adding a new field access
 * there means adding it here. NOTE: that file reads several fields through type
 * casts (`(ingredient as {...}).image_url`, `getCulinaryDetails`'s `root.*`),
 * which a plain `ingredient.field` grep misses — audit casts too.
