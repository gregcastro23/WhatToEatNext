# Phase 4: API Standardization Plan

## Overview

Phase 4 focuses on standardizing the API layer of the WhatToEatNext application. Following the successful migration of components to service-based architecture in Phase 3, we now need to ensure that all API endpoints follow consistent patterns, have proper error handling, and use standardized interfaces.

## Objectives

1. Document all existing API endpoints
2. Define standardized request/response interfaces
3. Implement consistent error handling and validation
4. Ensure proper typing throughout the API layer
5. Create a comprehensive testing strategy for API endpoints
6. Improve API performance and caching strategies

## Current API Status

During Phase 3, we migrated components to use service-based architecture, but we did not standardize the API endpoints themselves. Currently, we have a mix of:

- Direct data imports
- Service methods with inconsistent return types
- Varying error handling approaches
- Mixed use of async/await and promises
- Inconsistent parameter naming and ordering

## Action Plan

### 1. API Documentation and Analysis

**Tasks:**
- Create an inventory of all current API endpoints
- Document their inputs, outputs, and behavior
- Identify inconsistencies and areas for improvement
- Group related endpoints by domain (recipe, ingredient, etc.)

**Expected Timeline:** 1 week

### 2. Define API Standards

**Tasks:**
- Create standardized interfaces for common request/response patterns
- Define error handling conventions
- Establish naming conventions for endpoints and parameters
- Document pagination, filtering, and sorting patterns
- Create TypeScript types and interfaces for all API contracts

**Expected Timeline:** 1 week

### 3. Implement Service Layer Standardization

**Tasks:**
- Refactor service methods to follow the new standards
- Implement consistent error handling
- Add input validation
- Ensure proper TypeScript typing
- Add proper documentation (JSDoc)

**Expected Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

### 4. API Performance Optimization

**Tasks:**
- Implement efficient caching strategies
- Add support for partial data fetching
- Optimize data transformations
- Add request debouncing and throttling where appropriate

**Expected Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

### 5. Testing Framework

**Tasks:**
- Create a testing framework for API endpoints
- Add unit tests for each service method
- Implement integration tests for service interactions
- Create a mocking strategy for external dependencies

**Expected Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

## API Design Guidelines

### Request/Response Pattern

All API methods should follow this pattern:

```typescript
async function methodName(
  params: MethodNameParams
): Promise<MethodNameResponse> {
  try {
    // Implementation
    return {
      success: true,
      data: result
    };
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
    return {
      success: false,
      error: {
        code: getErrorCode(error),
        message: getErrorMessage(error)
      }
    };
  }
}
```

### Standard Response Interface

```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: unknown;
  };
  metadata?: {
    timestamp: number;
    version: string;
    cache?: {
      hit: boolean;
      age?: number;
    };
  };
}
```

### Error Handling

All service methods should:
1. Use try/catch blocks for error handling
2. Return standardized error objects
3. Log errors appropriately
4. Provide meaningful error messages to the client

### Documentation Format

All service methods should include proper JSDoc comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Gets a recipe by its ID.
 * 
 * @param params - The parameters for the request
 * @param params.id - The unique identifier of the recipe
 * @returns A promise that resolves to the recipe data
 * @throws {NotFoundError} If the recipe doesn't exist
 * @example
 * const result = await recipeService.getRecipeById({ id: '123' });
 * if (result.success) {
 *   const recipe = result.data;
 *   // Use recipe data
 * }
 */
```

## Prioritized API Domains

We will tackle API standardization in the following order:

1. **Recipe APIs** - Most critical for user experience
2. **Ingredient APIs** - Closely related to recipes
3. **Astrological APIs** - Foundation for recommendations
4. **Recommendation APIs** - Complex but high-value
5. **User Preference APIs** - Important for personalization
6. **Utility APIs** - Supporting services

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Test each service method in isolation
- Mock dependencies using Jest
- Test success and error scenarios
- Verify correct response structure

### Integration Tests

- Test interaction between services
- Verify data transformations
- Test end-to-end flows

### Performance Tests

- Measure response times
- Test caching effectiveness
- Simulate high load scenarios

## Expected Outcomes

After completing Phase 4:

1. All API endpoints will follow consistent patterns
2. Error handling will be robust and informative
3. TypeScript typing will ensure type safety throughout the application
4. Documentation will be comprehensive and up-to-date
5. Performance will be optimized through caching and other strategies
6. Testing will ensure reliability and correctness

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Breaking changes affect existing components | High | Medium | Create adapter layer for backward compatibility |
| Inconsistent implementation across teams | Medium | Medium | Provide clear guidelines and code review process |
| Performance degradation from additional layers | Medium | Low | Benchmark before and after, optimize where needed |
| Extended timeline due to scope creep | Medium | High | Clearly define MVP requirements and use phased approach |

## Next Steps

1. Begin with API inventory and documentation
2. Define standards and conventions
3. Implement standardization starting with Recipe APIs
4. Add comprehensive testing
5. Measure performance and optimize

## Conclusion

Phase 4 will build on the foundation laid in Phase 3, creating a robust and consistent API layer. This standardization will improve developer experience, reduce bugs, and prepare the application for future scaling and features.
