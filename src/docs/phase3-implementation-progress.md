## Migration Pattern

Each migrated component follows this standard pattern:

1. Import the `useServices` hook
2. Replace context hooks with the `useServices` hook
3. Handle loading and error states from services
4. Use proper service interfaces rather than direct implementation details
5. Implement proper useEffect dependencies
6. Use cache-friendly patterns where appropriate

## Next Steps

### Components to Migrate Next

With the completion of the CookingMethodsSection component, we have successfully
migrated all the components planned for Phase 3. The next step is to begin Phase
4 (API Standardization).

### Bridge Components

We've created bridge hooks to help with the transition:

1. `useAlchemicalBridge` - Bridges AlchemicalContext and services
2. `useChakraBridge` - Bridges ChakraContext and services
3. `usePlanetaryHoursBridge` - Bridges planetary hour functionality

These bridge hooks provide access to both legacy context data and new
service-based data during the transition period.

### Components to Preserve for Later Phases

The following components are part of the main user flow and will be migrated in
a later phase:

1. All components in `src/components/FoodRecommender` (except FoodRecommender
   itself)

### Testing Strategy

For each migrated component:

1. Create a testing page in the `/app/test` directory
2. Add both original and migrated components to compare behavior
3. Verify that data loading, display and interactions behave identically

We've implemented a test page at `/app/test/migrated-components` that allows
comparing original and migrated components side by side.

### Next Phase Planning

Begin planning for Phase 4 (API Standardization):

1. Document current API endpoints in use
2. Define standard request/response interfaces
3. Implement proper error handling and validation

## Additional Considerations

1. Create a standard migration checklist for developers
2. Consider implementing a toggle mechanism to switch between legacy and new
   components
3. Update the component analysis tool to track migration progress

## Conclusion

Phase 3 implementation is now complete with all planned components successfully
migrated. The established pattern has worked effectively and can be used as a
reference for future component migrations. The focus can now shift to Phase 4
(API Standardization) to ensure consistent API behavior across the application.
