// Type definitions for @testing-library/jest-dom
// The types are provided by the @testing-library/jest-dom package
// This file should only be used in test contexts (tsconfig.jest.json)
// The triple-slash reference has been removed to prevent TypeScript errors
// in the main build process where @testing-library/jest-dom types are not needed
