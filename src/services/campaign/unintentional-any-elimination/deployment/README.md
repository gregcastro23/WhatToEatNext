# Deployment Automation System

This directory contains the comprehensive deployment automation system for the Unintentional Any Elimination campaign. The system provides phased rollout management, monitoring setup, integration testing, and rollback procedures.

## Overview

The deployment system automates the complete deployment lifecycle:
- **Phased Rollout**: Sequential deployment phases with validation checkpoints
- **Monitoring Setup**: Automated monitoring and alerting configuration
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive testing within the deployment pipeline
- **Rollback Procedures**: Automated rollback on deployment failures

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **`index.ts`**: Main deployment manager and phase execution engine
- **`cli.ts`**: Command-line interface for deployment operations
- **`setup-monitoring.ts`**: Monitoring and alerting setup automation
- **`validate-monitoring.ts`**: Monitoring system validation

### Deployment Phases

1. **Pre-deployment Validation**: System readiness and dependency checks
2. **Configuration Deployment**: Configuration validation and setup
3. **System Integration**: Integration with existing campaign system
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Monitoring and alerting system configuration
5. **Final Validation**: Complete system validation and readiness check

## Usage

### Basic Deployment

```bash
# Execute full deployment
npx tsx src/services/campaign/unintentional-any-elimination/deployment/cli.ts deploy

# Deploy specific phases
npx tsx src/services/campaign/unintentional-any-elimination/deployment/cli.ts deploy --phases pre-deployment,configuration-deployment

# Dry run (show what would be deployed)
npx tsx src/services/campaign/unintentional-any-elimination/deployment/cli.ts deploy --dry-run
```
### Monitoring Management

```bash
# Setup monitoring and alerting
npx tsx src/services/campaign/unintentional-any-elimination/deployment/cli.ts monitoring setup

# Validate monitoring setup
npx tsx src/services/campaign/unintentional-any-elimination/deployment/cli.ts monitoring validate

# Check monitoring status
npx tsx src/services/campaign/unintentional-any-elimination/deployment/cli.ts monitoring status
```

### Validation and Status

```bash
# Validate deployment readiness
npx tsx src/services/campaign/unintentional-any-elimination/deployment/cli.ts validate

# Validate specific phase
npx tsx src/services/campaign/unintentional-any-elimination/deployment/cli.ts validate --phase pre-deployment

# Show deployment status
npx tsx src/services/campaign/unintentional-any-elimination/deployment/cli.ts status
```

### Rollback Procedures

```bash
# Rollback entire deployment
npx tsx src/services/campaign/unintentional-any-elimination/deployment/cli.ts rollback --confirm

# Rollback specific phase
npx tsx src/services/campaign/unintentional-any-elimination/deployment/cli.ts rollback --phase configuration-deployment --confirm
```

- Required directories exist
- Environment configuration loaded

### Phase 3: System Integration

**Purpose**: Integrate with existing campaign system
**Tasks**:
- Run integration tests
- Verify campaign system compatibility
- Validate service integrations

**Success Criteria**:
- Integration tests pass
- Campaign system recognizes new components
- Service endpoints respond correctly

### Phase 4: Monitoring Setup

**Purpose**: Setup monitoring and alerting systems
**Tasks**:
- Configure monitoring service
- Setup alerting channels
- Create health check endpoints

**Success Criteria**:
- Monitoring service starts successfully
- Alert channels configured
- Health checks respond

### Phase 5: Final Validation

**Purpose**: Final system validation and readiness check
**Tasks**:
- Run full test suite
- Execute linting checks
- Perform end-to-end validation

**Success Criteria**:
- All tests pass
- Linting passes
- System ready for operation

## Configuration

### Environment-Specific Deployment

The deployment system uses environment-aware configuration:

```typescript
// Development deployment
NODE_ENV=development npx tsx deployment/cli.ts deploy

// Production deployment
NODE_ENV=production npx tsx deployment/cli.ts deploy

// Testing deployment
NODE_ENV=testing npx tsx deployment/cli.ts deploy
```

### Custom Deployment Configuration

```bash
# Export current deployment configuration
npx tsx deployment/cli.ts export-config deployment-config.json

# Import custom deployment configuration
npx tsx deployment/cli.ts import-config custom-deployment.json

# Deploy with custom configuration
npx tsx deployment/cli.ts deploy --config custom-deployment.json
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Monitoring Setup

The deployment system automatically configures comprehensive monitoring:

- **Metrics Collection**: TypeScript errors, success rates, build status
- **Health Checks**: Build health, configuration health, integration health
- **Alerting**: Console alerts, file logging, configurable thresholds
- **Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring dashboard

### Alert Conditions

- **High Error Rate**: TypeScript error count increased significantly
- **Low Success Rate**: Campaign success rate below minimum threshold
- **Build Failure**: Build process failed during campaign execution
- **Configuration Invalid**: Campaign configuration validation failed
- **Rollback Triggered**: Safety protocol triggered rollback

### Monitoring Dashboard

```bash
# Start monitoring dashboard
npx tsx .kiro/monitoring/dashboard.ts

# Start monitoring service
bash .kiro/monitoring/start-monitoring.sh
```

## Safety and Rollback

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

- Critical task failures
- Validation check failures
- Build compilation errors
- Configuration validation errors

### Manual Rollback Procedures

```bash
# Emergency rollback
npx tsx deployment/cli.ts rollback --confirm

# Phase-specific rollback
npx tsx deployment/cli.ts rollback --phase system-integration --confirm

# Rollback to specific checkpoint
npx tsx deployment/cli.ts rollback --to checkpoint-id --confirm
```

### Rollback Safety

- All rollback operations create logs
- Original state is preserved through backups
- Rollback operations are validated before execution
- Multiple rollback strategies available

## Integration Testing

### Automated Testing in Pipeline

The deployment pipeline includes comprehensive testing:

```typescript
// Integration test execution
{
  id: 'run-integration-tests',
  name: 'Run Integration Tests',
  command: 'npm',
  args: ['test', '--', '--testPathPattern=integration'],
  timeout: 300000,
  retries: 1,
  critical: true
}
```

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: Component-level testing
- **Integration Tests**: System integration validation
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflow testing
- **Configuration Tests**: Configuration validation testing

### Test Execution

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run integration tests only
npm test -- --testPathPattern=integration

# Run deployment-specific tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern=deployment
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Deployment Fails at Pre-deployment**
```bash
# Check build status
yarn build

# Check TypeScript compilation
yarn tsc --noEmit

# Validate dependencies
yarn install
```

**Configuration Deployment Fails**
```bash
# Validate configuration
npx tsx config/cli.ts validate

# Check configuration directories
ls -la .kiro/campaign-configs/

# Reset configuration
npx tsx config/cli.ts reset --confirm
```

**Monitoring Setup Fails**
```bash
# Validate monitoring setup
npx tsx deployment/validate-monitoring.ts

# Check monitoring directories
ls -la .kiro/monitoring/

# Re-run monitoring setup
npx tsx deployment/setup-monitoring.ts
```

### Recovery Procedures

**Complete Deployment Reset**
```bash
# Stop any running processes
pkill -f "unintentional-any"

# Clean deployment artifacts
rm -rf .kiro/logs/deployment-*
rm -rf .kiro/monitoring/

# Reset configuration
npx tsx config/cli.ts reset --confirm

# Re-run deployment
npx tsx deployment/cli.ts deploy
```

**Partial Recovery**
```bash
# Rollback to last known good state
npx tsx deployment/cli.ts rollback --confirm

# Validate system state
npx tsx deployment/cli.ts validate

# Resume deployment from specific phase
npx tsx deployment/cli.ts deploy --phases system-integration,monitoring-setup,final-validation
```

## Best Practices

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Always Validate First**: Run validation before deployment
2. **Use Dry Run**: Test deployment configuration with --dry-run
3. **Monitor Progress**: Watch deployment logs and monitoring dashboard
4. **Have Rollback Ready**: Ensure rollback procedures are tested

### Environment Management

1. **Environment-Specific Configs**: Use appropriate environment configurations
2. **Staging First**: Deploy to staging/testing environment first
3. **Production Safety**: Use maximum safety levels in production
4. **Configuration Backup**: Export configuration before changes

### Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Keep monitoring service running
2. **Alert Thresholds**: Set appropriate alert thresholds
3. **Log Retention**: Configure appropriate log retention periods
4. **Dashboard Monitoring**: Regularly check monitoring dashboard
