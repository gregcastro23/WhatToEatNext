## Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Establish Baseline**
   ```bash
   node src/scripts/progress-tracking/cli.cjs establish-baseline --verbose
   ```

2. **Start Real-Time Monitoring**
   ```bash
   node src/scripts/progress-tracking/cli.cjs start-monitoring --interval 30
   ```

3. **Generate Progress Report**
   ```bash
   node src/scripts/progress-tracking/cli.cjs generate-report --show
   ```

4. **View Current Summary**
   ```bash
   node src/scripts/progress-tracking/cli.cjs show-summary
   ```

### Detailed Usage

#### Baseline Establishment
```bash
# Basic baseline establishment
node src/scripts/progress-tracking/cli.cjs establish-baseline

# Verbose output with detailed metrics
node src/scripts/progress-tracking/cli.cjs establish-baseline --verbose
```

#### Real-Time Monitoring
```bash
# Start monitoring with default 30-second intervals
node src/scripts/progress-tracking/cli.cjs start-monitoring

# Custom monitoring interval (10 seconds)
node src/scripts/progress-tracking/cli.cjs start-monitoring --interval 10

# Stop monitoring with Ctrl+C
```

#### Report Generation
```bash
# Generate full comprehensive report
node src/scripts/progress-tracking/cli.cjs generate-report

# Generate report and show executive summary
node src/scripts/progress-tracking/cli.cjs generate-report --show

# Show only executive summary
node src/scripts/progress-tracking/cli.cjs show-summary
```

## Integration with Campaign System

### Batch Processing Integration
The progress tracking system integrates seamlessly with the batch processing system:

```javascript
const monitor = new RealTimeProgressMonitor();
await monitor.initialize(baselineData);
monitor.startMonitoring();

// Start a batch
const batch = await monitor.startBatch({
  fileCount: 15,
  variableCount: 45,
  batchType: 'elimination'
});

// Update batch progress
await monitor.updateBatchProgress(batch.batchId, {
  processedVariables: 20,
  totalVariables: 45,
  metrics: {
    variablesEliminated: 15,
    variablesPreserved: 5,
    errors: 0
  }
});

// Complete batch
await monitor.completeBatch(batch.batchId, finalMetrics);
```

### Error Tracking Integration
```javascript
// Log an error
const errorId = monitor.logError('compilation-error', error);

// Log recovery action
monitor.logRecoveryAction(errorId, 'git-stash-rollback', true);

// Add notification
monitor.addNotification('batch-completed', 'Batch 5 completed successfully', 'success');
```

## Data Files

The system creates and maintains several data files:

### Configuration Files
- `.kiro/specs/unused-variable-elimination/baseline-metrics.json` - Current baseline data
- `.kiro/specs/unused-variable-elimination/baseline-history.json` - Historical baselines
- `.kiro/specs/unused-variable-elimination/progress-tracking.json` - Real-time progress data
- `.kiro/specs/unused-variable-elimination/real-time-metrics.json` - Current metrics summary
- `.kiro/specs/unused-variable-elimination/error-log.json` - Error and recovery log

### Report Files
- `.kiro/specs/unused-variable-elimination/reports/` - Generated reports directory
- `comprehensive-progress-report-[timestamp].json` - Full detailed reports
- `progress-summary-[timestamp].json` - Executive summary reports

- Check TypeScript and ESLint configurations
- Verify yarn/npm commands are available
- Ensure sufficient disk space for analysis
- Review file permissions for data directories

**Monitoring Not Starting**
- Verify baseline data exists and is valid
- Check for port conflicts or resource constraints
- Review error logs for specific failure reasons
- Ensure proper file system permissions

**Report Generation Errors**

- Check data file format and integrity
- Ensure sufficient memory for large datasets
- Review file system permissions for report directory

**Data Quality Issues**
- Review confidence scores and quality assessments

- Monitor system memory during operation
- Implement data streaming for large reports
- Use pagination for historical data analysis
- Clear old data files periodically

**Processing Speed**
- Optimize metric collection queries
- Use caching for frequently accessed data
- Implement parallel processing where possible
- Profile and optimize bottleneck operations
