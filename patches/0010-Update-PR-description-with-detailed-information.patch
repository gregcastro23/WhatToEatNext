+# May 2025 Planetary Position Updates
+
+## Changes
+- Updated fallback planetary positions from May 2024 to May 2025 data
+- Added validation functions to verify positions against transit dates
+- Implemented a utility for analyzing transit date accuracy
+- Enhanced the UI to display validation results and discrepancies
+
+## Impact
+These updates ensure accurate astrological calculations by:
+- Providing reliable fallback positions if API calls fail
+- Validating calculated positions against known transit dates
+- Offering tools to keep transit dates current
+- Improving transparency about position data quality
+
+## Testing Done
+- Verified all May 2025 positions against ephemeris data
+- Tested fallback mechanism by simulating API failures
+- Validated transit date checking against known planet movements
+- Confirmed UI correctly displays validation results
+
+## Deployment Notes
+This update requires a full rebuild but has no database dependencies.
